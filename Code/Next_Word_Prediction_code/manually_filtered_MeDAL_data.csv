2876679,this T0 was undertaken to investigate the effect of intravenous acetylstrophanthidine and digoxin on the gracilis V1 resistance of hypotensive dogs the gracilis muscle was isolated and separately perfused but the nerve to the muscle was left IN acetylstrophanthidin mg iv and digoxin mg iv both produced a sustained vasodilator response in the gracilis V1 bed of all the hypotensive animals mean arterial pressure mmhg a shortlasting vasoconstriction preceded the vasodilation in response to acetylstrophanthidin in of the animals prior local alphaadrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine did not have any significant effect on vasodilation prior local cholinergic receptor blockade with atropine however abolished the sustained vasodilator response thus indicating that the mechanism responsible for this neurogenic effect is ACh in contrast in the normotensive dogs the response to intravenously po digoxin was sustained vasoconstriction which was abolished by prior local alphaadrenergic ARB thus the effect of digitalis glycosides on peripheral V1 resistance is importantly affected by the background level of sympathetic activity,117,cholinergic
7271743,the objectives of the present T0 were to investigate the enzymatic characteristics of BB aromatase in japanese eel anguilla japonica as well as the correlations between aromatase MICs in various tissues BB regions PIT and gonads and ovarian OD eel BB aromatase exhibited a km of nm and a vmax of fmolmin mg protein fmolh mg protein indicating an enzymatic activity much lower than in other teleosts but similar to that in mammals this supports the hypothesis of the occurrence of a single aromatase gene in eels representative of an ancient group of teleosts elopomorphs as in mammals but unlike what is observed in more recent teleosts AIs could significantly suppress BB and pituitary AA there was no significant sex difference in AA in the forebrain midbrain hindbrain or PIT but there was in the gonads where aromatase could be detected in the ovaries but not in the testes in accordance with the role of this enzyme in ovarian differentiation comparison with another teleost black porgy percomorph under the same experimental conditions further confirmed the low activity of aromatase in the eel we investigated variations in brain PIT and gonad AA in relation to ovarian development in control female eels GSI gsi as well as in eels treated with pituitary extract experimental ovarian maturation gsi up to differential expression of neural and gonadal aromatase was observed in relation to the course of gonadal development PIT AA increased with gsi at all stages BB specially forebrain aromatase activity significantly increased in early vitellogenic control eels gsi and in treated eels the low activity of eel aromatase may be related to the characteristic life cycle of the eel in which there is a long delay of the onset of puberty before oceanic reproductive migration,111,brain
11043287,this T0 investigated whether perinatal SE to diuron DCMU might exert adverse effects on rat lymphoid organs pregnant spraguedawley sd rats were exposed to diuron at or ppm in the diet from gestational days gd and during lactation at postnatal day pnd male pups were euthanized and thymus SP mesenteric lymph node and femur were collected for histopathological analysis food consumption and body weight gain were significantly reduced in dams exposed to ppm during gestation period also diuron at and ppm produced increased relative spleen weight associated histologically with severe congestion in red pulp enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis and hemosiderosis as well as depletion of lymphoid follicles in WG pulp flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant reduction in b lymphocytes cdra in male pups but t lymphocytes cd cd and cdcd were not markedly affected thus data suggest that diuroninduced maternal toxicity in dams exposed to high dose and perinatal SE to this herbicide produced spleen toxicity as evidenced by a reduction in b lymphocyte number in male sd pups,48,spleen
5681650,this T0 investigated the penetrability of dentinal tubules in cavity walls lined with different DBS occlusal class i cavities were prepared in premolars the cavities in the control group had an intact smear SL without a lining while those in the experimental group were lined with gluma cps scotchbond multipurpose plus or OS the penetrability of the dentinal tubules was tested with a dye basic fuchsin or bacteria s faecalis immediately after adhesive lining and T3 onemonth storage in water at degrees c some of the lined samples were sectioned and examined under the sem in some samples in the EG the dye penetrated to the pulp and bacteria up to microm into the dentinal tubules immediately after lining the kruskal wallis anova and tukey test showed the depth of dye and bacterial penetration to be significantly less in teeth with bonding systems than those in the control group p however there was no statistically significant difference between the control and exp groups after storage in water p sem examination showed that the hybrid SL and resin tags were present in the cavity walls immediately after lining but absent T3 storage in water therefore adhesive linings under the exp conditions were ineffective in preventing dye or bacterial penetration of the dentinal tubules,100,experimental group
4100285,this T0 was designed to test the hypothesis that brcamp and brcgmp dependent EC50 of phorbol dibutyrate stimulated contractions of IN rat aorta are independent of changes in the level of myosin light chain phosphorylation phorbol dibutyrate stimulated contraction with a concomitant increase in myosin CS chain phosphorylation in normal tissues and without an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation in calciumdepleted tissues phorbol dibutyrate stimulated contractions in normal caclcontaining PSS were relaxed in a concentrationdependent manner by brcamp and brcgmp phorbol dibutyrateinduced contractions in the absence of ca were only relaxed by brcgmp brcamp had no effect the relaxation induced by brcgmp was associated with a decrease in MLCP suggesting that cgmpdependent protein kinase may alter the activity of either the S1 CS chain kinase or phosphatase the relaxation induced by brcamp was not associated with a decrease in phosphorylation suggesting that campdependent protein kinase may uncouple myosin light chain phosphorylation from force,122,myosin
840766,in this T0 circulating concentrations of intermediary metabolites were measured in eight nonobese subjects with motor neurone disease in the basal postabsorptive state and after a g oral gl challenge eight healthy subjects of similar age and body mass index served as controls basal Pyr concentration was significantly elevated in the subjects with MND p less than after oral gl ingestion overall levels of Pyr p less than and lactate p less than were significantly higher in these subjects blood glucose concentrations fulfilled the criteria diagnostic of impaired glucose tolerance in six of the eight subjects with motor neurone disease who cumulative insulin levels were slightly higher in these subjects and peak insulin response was delayed min vs min relative to the HCs circulating concentrations of alanine glycerol nonesterified fatty acids and total ketone bodies were similar between groups these results confirm that IGT is a common feature of motor neurone disease furthermore our data indicate disordered regulation of both pyruvate and lactate metabolism consistent with reports of defective skeletal muscle Pyr oxidation in individuals with this disorder in contrast our results indicate that the regulation of lipolysis and ketone body metabolism is unimpaired in MND,64,pyruvate

6577658,this T0 focuses on the standardization of techniques across laboratories to enable multiple datasets to be compared and combined in order to obtain reliable and robust widescale patterns of diversity a set of protocols using a core collection of simple sequence repeat ssr markers reference lines and standard alleles plus a common system of S2 nomenclature was adopted in the study of maize genetic diversity in a network of laboratories in asia pairwise S2 comparisons of the REF lines done to assess the general PA between datasets from four laboratories showed error rates raw ranging from to which were reduced to less than after adjustments of correctable errors and further reduced to less than after the exclusion of all markers with greater than individual error rates overall of the total mismatches were due to frameshift errors to wrong allele size to failed amplification and to extra alleles higher genetic similarity values of the reference lines were achieved using fewer markers with data of higher SQ rather than with more markers of questionable quality CA of the merged datasets showed the lines from southern china to be highly diverse falling into six of the seven clusters observed and all well represented by tester lines the lines from indonesia fell into five of six groups with two main CG represented by tester lines the cimmyt lines developed for the asian region showed a relatively narrow genetic base falling in two out of seven and in three out of six clusters in china and indonesia respectively in contrast to the case in southern china where of the lines clustered separately from the cimmyt lines lines in the indonesian breeding program show a closer relationship with the cimmyt lines reflecting a long history of germplasm exchange,73,allele
10617961,in the present T0 quantitative realtime pcr was used to determine the expression status of eight imprinted genes grb h igfr xist igf nnat peg and peg during preimplantation development in normal fertilized and uniparental porcine embryos the results demonstrated that in all observed embryo samples a non imprinted mRNA DP up to the cell stage of OD was common for most genes this was true for all classes of embryo regardless of parentalorigins and the direction of imprint however several differentially expressed genes h igf xist and peg were detected amongst the classes at the blastocyst stage of development most interestingly and despite the fact that maternally and paternally expressed genes should not be expressed in androgenones and parthenogenones respectively both uniparental embryos expressed these genes when tested for in this T0 in order to account for this phenomenon we compared the expression patterns of eight imprinted genes along with the methylation status of the igfh dmr in haploid and 2C parthenogenetic embryos our findings revealed that igf nnat and peg were silenced in haploid but not diploid parthenogenetic blastocysts and differential methylation of the igfh dmr was consistently observed between haploid and 2C parthenogenetic blastocysts these results appear to suggest that there exists a process to adjust the expression status of imprinted genes in diploid parthenogenetic embryos and that this phenomenon may be associated with altered methylation at an imprinting control region in addition we believe that imprinted expression occurs in at least four genes namely h igf xist and peg in porcine blastocyst stage embryos,194,diploid

10848079,in this T0 we investigated in groups of female balbc mice injected with crotalus durissus terrificus venom cdt the renal CF based on creatinine clearance percentage of FE cytokines and histological examination of renal tissue cdt caused renal alterations that induced PU during the initial hours postvenom and reduced creatinine clearance min up to hours postvenom administration in urine from mice injected with cdt induced a decrease in il levels more pronounced increments of il il and ifnÃŽÂ³ were observed T3 and min respectively the highest levels of tnf and il were observed at and hs respectively the ratios of pro and antiinflammatory cytokines in animals injected with cdt which may be manifested in the inflammatory status during the envenoming in CG of animals treated with cdt were observed a decreasing in creatinine clearance and its effect on glomerular filtration rate was accompanied by decreased fractional excretion of cytokines and morphologic disturbances this loss of NC selectively in envenomation could thus explain why the ate or enzyme is in excess and the quasisteadystate is achieved we demonstrate that this generalization is grossly inadequate and propose another generalization based on application of the quasisteadystate condition and conservation equations for both enzyme and substrate the standard hmm equation is derived by a assuming the quasisteadystate condition b applying the conservation equation only for the enzyme and c assuming that the ATP concentration at quasisteadystate can be approximated by the total ATP concentration s in our formula the rate is already expressed through s and we only assume that when quasisteadystate is achieved the amount of product formed is negligible compared to s numerical simulations show that our formula is generally more accurate than the hmm formula and also can provide a good approximation when the enzyme is in excess which is not the case for the hmm formula we show that the hmm formula can be derived from our expression by further assuming that the total enzyme concentration is negligible compared to s,238,substrate
15545227,in the present work principal coordinate analysis pcoa is introduced to develop a robust MM to classify the chromatographic data sets of PGN sample pcoa captures the heterogeneity present in the data sets by using the dissimilarity matrix as input thus in principle it can even capture the subtle differences in the bacterial peptidoglycan composition and can provide a more robust and fast approach for classifying the bacterial collection and identifying the novel cell wall targets for further biological and clinical studies the utility of the proposed approach is successfully demonstrated by analysing the two different kind of bacterial collections the first set comprised of PGN sample belonging to different subclasses of alphaproteobacteria whereas the second set that is relatively more intricate for the chemometric analysis consist of different wild type vibrio cholerae and its mutants having subtle differences in their peptidoglycan composition the present work clearly proposes a useful RPA that can classify the chromatographic data sets of chromatographic peptidoglycan samples having subtle differences furthermore present work clearly suggest that pcoa can be a method of choice in any data analysis workflow,105,peptidoglycan
6042903,this T0 clarifies the identity and development of the male in the life cycle of symbion pandora the male is not produced directly by the FF stage as previously thought but arises as a distinct individual from budding cells inside an intermediate stage named the prometheus L3 the morphology and the development of the two distinct stages are described with light and electron microscopy furthermore the following terminology is suggested to clearly distinguish between the different individuals the prometheus larva which is the freeswimming individual being produced inside the feeding stage the attached prometheus larva on the FF stage which mostly degenerates following settlement except for the internal budding cells and the dwarf male which is the ciliated sexually mature stage the budding cells inside the attached prometheus L3 usually develop two internal dwarf males each dw male is heavily ciliated and has a welldeveloped nervous system with a relatively C1 BB numerous gland and muscle cells testis with bundles of sperm and one penial structure the male lacks a gut as in the other free stages in the life cycle of symbion pandora this T0 also indicates that the dw male is freed from the attached prometheus larva copulation which has not been observed yet probably takes place between a freeswimming male and the female either while the female is released or afterwards,46,larva
7032463,the objective of this study was to test the hypotheses that the steadystate friction coefficient of AC is significantly smaller under cyclical compressive loading than the equilibrium friction coefficient under static loading and decreases as a CF of loading frequency the steadystate cartilage ISF load support remains significantly greater than zero under cyclical compressive loading and increases as a CF of loading frequency unconfined compression tests with sliding of bovine shoulder cartilage against glass in saline were carried out on fresh cylindrical plugs n under three sinusoidal loading frequencies and hz and under static loading the timedependent friction coefficient mueff was measured the interstitial fluid load support was also predicted theoretically under static loading mueff increased from a minimum value mumin to an equilibrium value mueq in cyclical compressive loading tests mueff similarly rose from a minimum value mumin and at and hz and reached a steadystate response oscillating between a lowerbound mulb and and upper bound muub and for all frequencies it was found that muubmueq and mulbmueqp under cyclical compressive loading the ISF load support was found to oscillate above and below the static loading response with suction occurring over a portion of the loading cycle at steadystate conditions all theoretical predictions and most experimental results demonstrated little sensitivity to loading frequency on the basis of these results both hypotheses were rejected cyclical compressive loading is nowas CS was measured every h for weeks we also monitored the incidence of phage excretion in stools of cholera patients during the epidemic the peak of the epidemic was preceded by high v cholerae prevalence in the environment and was followed by high jsf phage C2 as the epidemic ended the buildup to the phage peak in the environment coincided with increasing excretion of the same phage in the stools of cholera patients these results suggest that patients toward the end of the epidemic ingested both jsf phage and the outbreak v cholerae CS hostmediated phage amplification during the cholera epidemic likely contributed to increased environmental phage abundance decreased load of environmental v cholerae and hence the collapse of the epidemic thus in vivo phage amplification in patients and subsequent phage predation in the environment may explain the selflimiting nature of seasonal cholera epidemics in bangladesh,43,interstitial fluid

5505062,this T0 examined the relationship of parental trauma exposure and ptsd to the development of PTS disorder ptsd depressive and anxiety disorders in the AD offspring of holocaust survivors one hundred and thirtyfive subjects men and women were divided into three groups according to parental trauma SE and ptsd subjects were offspring of holocaust survivors who endorsed having at least one parent with ptsd were F1 of holocaust survivors who reported having no parent with ptsd and were demographically similar subjects with no parental holocaust SE all subjects underwent a comprehensive psychiatric interview in which information about lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and exposure to traumatic events was obtained subjects also completed a checklist based on the dsmiv symptoms of ptsd to estimate the symptom severity of ptsd in their parents a presumptive diagnosis of parental ptsd was assigned according to dsmiv criteria forward and forced entry stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to determine the effects of parental exposure parental ptsd and the subjects own history of trauma in the development of ptsd depressive and anxiety disorders in the offspring the findings demonstrate a specific association between parental ptsd and the occurrence of ptsd in F1 additionally parental trauma exposure more than parental ptsd was found to be significantly associated with lifetime depressive disorder the ID of parental ptsd as a risk factor for ptsd in F1 of holocaust survivors defines a sample in which the biological and psychological correlates of risk for ptsd can be further examined,65,offspring
4915480,this T0 investigated the effects of quantity and type of diet fed to superovulated donor heifers on molecular and metabolic indices of embryonic development these effects included the relative abundances of mrnas for the alpha subunit of nakatpase and the antioxidant enzyme cuznsod as well as pyruvate utilization in bovine morulae and blastocysts developed in vivo heifers were fed a daily ration of either grass silage and a citrusbeet pulpbased concentrate or grass silage and a barleybased concentrate for days both at kg per day or ad libitum in embryos derived from heifers fed the pulpbased diets the relative abundances of the transcripts were not affected by either day of collection or quantity of diet in embryos derived from heifers fed the barleybased diets the relative abundances of the nakatpase transcripts were also not changed by these main effects while the relative abundances of the cuznsod transcripts were affected by day of collection and by the quantity of diet pyruvate metabolism was affected by day of collection and was significantly increased in day embryos compared with day and day embryos diet quantity did not affect Pyr utilization whereas diet type did increase pyruvate metabolism in the barley group when compared with the pulp group the results of this T0 show for the first time that molecular and metabolic variations may exist in embryos derived in vivo and developed in donor heifers on nutritional regimens differing in type and quantity differences in embryos collected on different developmental days may be attributed to varying cell numbers alterations in the relative abundances of the cuznsod transcripts and Pyr metabolism caused by the quantity of diet fed to the donor animal were likely to have been due to alterations in metabolic end products that accumulate in reproductive tract fluids whereas differences in embryonic metabolism caused by type of diet are related to the composition of the diet these findings characterize embryos produced in vivo at the molecular level indicating that the molecular markers used in the present T0 can differentiate between populations of embryos produced under different nutritional regimens and determine conditions conductive to the production of good quality embryos,264,pyruvate
