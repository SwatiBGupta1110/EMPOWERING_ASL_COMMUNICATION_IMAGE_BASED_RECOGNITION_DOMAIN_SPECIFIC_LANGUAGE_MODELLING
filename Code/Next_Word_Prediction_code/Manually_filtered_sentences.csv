802438,we investigated whether tumor cell lysis by lymphokineactivated killer lak cells was enhanced by treatment of the tumor cells with cisplatin cddp in vitro tumor cells were treated with cddp in vitro and the cytotoxic activity for lak cells was measured by h crrelease CA the alterations of succinate dehydrogenase sd activity and dnarna synthesis of tumor cells were analysed the susceptibility of cddptreated microgramsml h daudi and katoiii cells to lysis by short termcultured lak cells was enhanced as was the susceptibility of cddptreated microgramsml h autologous tumor and daudi cells to lysis by long termcultured lak cells sd activity and dna synthesis in RT cells were impaired by h treatment with microgramsml of cddp whereas those were not altered by h treatment with microgramsml of cddp the enhancement of the susceptibility of cddptreated RT cells to long termcultured lak cells was thus elucidated it was shown to be due to alterations of the RT cells with regard to their sd activity and dna synthesis it is suggested that the combined therapy with cddp and lak cells offers hope for increasing the response rate and the longterm survival of cancer patients,135,tumor
859112,in this T0 S1 heavy chain from sea urchin pluteus larvae was characterized by analysis of a kb cdna clone dna CS of bp demonstrated a similarity in the deduced CAA sequence to the embryonic rat skeletal muscle CS antibodies generated against a polypeptide encoded by the open reading frame of the cdna clone specifically identified a kda myosin protein which accumulated in muscle cells differentiating bilateral to the esophagus beginning at early larval stages this same S1 also accumulated in cells of the endodermal epithelium that comprise the three sphincters of the larval gut thus a gene encoding S1 heavy chain is expressed in dissimilar cell types of the macromere lineage and the pattern of accumulation in the gut identifies functionally distinct cells of the endodermal epithelium,99,myosin
6505584,a yearold woman with a tentative diagnosis of GBC had undergone cholecystectomy with liver resection and dissection of regional CL NO pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed welldifferentiated PTC adenocarcinoma of the GB with subserosal invasion no evidence of metastasis was noted in the dissected lymph NO after surgery she had been disease free in the followup study ten years after surgery however carcinoma arising from the common bile duct was newly found and pancreaticoduodenectomy with regional lymph NO dissection was performed histological examination confirmed welldifferentiated adenocarcinoma of the common bile duct lymph NO had no evidence of malignancy the patient has been doing well with no evidence of recurrence and years T3 each T0 respectively apparently these two cancers occurred independently and each surgical treatment for this patient was successful,19,lymph
2876679,this T0 was undertaken to investigate the effect of intravenous acetylstrophanthidine and digoxin on the gracilis V1 resistance of hypotensive dogs the gracilis muscle was isolated and separately perfused but the nerve to the muscle was left IN acetylstrophanthidin mg iv and digoxin mg iv both produced a sustained vasodilator response in the gracilis V1 bed of all the hypotensive animals mean arterial pressure mmhg a shortlasting vasoconstriction preceded the vasodilation in response to acetylstrophanthidin in of the animals prior local alphaadrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine did not have any significant effect on vasodilation prior local cholinergic receptor blockade with atropine however abolished the sustained vasodilator response thus indicating that the mechanism responsible for this neurogenic effect is ACh in contrast in the normotensive dogs the response to intravenously po digoxin was sustained vasoconstriction which was abolished by prior local alphaadrenergic ARB thus the effect of digitalis glycosides on peripheral V1 resistance is importantly affected by the background level of sympathetic activity,117,cholinergic
15099250,this study aimed to analyze the effect of patient positions on the lordosis and scoliosis of patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis dlsseventyseven patients with dls were retrospectively analyzed we measured lordosis and cobbs angle on preoperative upright xrays and magnetic resonance imagings in supine position the lordosis and scoliosis of surgical segments in intraoperative prone position were measured on intraoperative radiographs of patients to compare with that in standing position paired t tests were performed to investigate the parameters of the samplefrom standing to supine position the whole lordosis increased Ã‚Â± degree vs Ã‚Â± degree and the whole scoliosis decreased Ã‚Â± degree vs Ã‚Â± degree of cases had increased lordosis and of cases had decreased scoliosis the lordosis of surgical segments in standing position had no difference with that in intraoprerative PP but in changing from supinestanding position to intraoprerative PP the scoliosis of surgical segments decreased Ã‚Â± degree vs Ã‚Â± degree Ã‚Â± degree vs Ã‚Â± degree respectively and of cases had decreased scoliosis in intraoperative prone position than that in standing positioncompared with standing position in dls patients SP increased lordosis and reduced scoliosis and intraoperative prone position reduced scoliosis significantly when evaluating the severity of dls and making preoperative surgical plans lumbar lordosis in SP should also be evaluated in addition to upright xray and the effects of different positions should be taken into consideration to reduce deviation,140,prone position
12276237,a method for the CR separation of SU phosphate synthetase ec and SU synthetase ec from wheat triticum aestivum l germ is described the separation is achieved by chromatography on deaecellulose at ph the sucrose phosphate synthetase obtained can be further purified by GF disc electrophoresis of sucrose phosphate preparations reveals the presence of isoenzymes molecular weight estimates of SU phosphate synthetase by GF and sedimentation velocity give a value of the enzyme is inhibited by various anions particularly citrate maleate and phosphate activity estimate should be carried out with goods buffers in order to avoid inhibition nucleoside triphosphates are competitive inhibitors toward udpglucose the enzyme is sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents but activity can be restored with dtt or ÃŽÂ²mercapto ethanol the fact that the enzyme is inhibited by ÃŽÂ´gluconolactone suggests that the reaction occurs through the formation of an unstable glucoseenzyme complex mg can restore enzyme activity to control values when inhibited by nucleoside triphosphates citrate or phosphate,7,sucrose
7011946,the aim of this study was to develop the use of daily diaries of affects and events as measures of pharmacological effects on affective processes and to apply them to evaluate the possible affective toxicity of metoclopramide and NAP two medications commonly used in geriatric practice in all adults aged years or older were randomized to receive metoclopramide up to mgday NAP up to mgday or PL under doubleblind conditions for a period of weeks patients were seen weekly for evaluations of affective and cognitive outcomes as well as safety in addition patients kept diaries with daily records of positive and negative affect and reports of significant daily events findings included mixed MM analyses of drug assignment time events and interactions for both PA and days with significant negative affect subjects exhibited high C2 of adherence in completing daily diaries neither the DP of dropouts nor the weekly assessments demonstrated significant drug effects on mood or affect however diary data demonstrated that metoclopramide increased the apparent impact of negative events on both positive and negative affect relative to placebo and that naproxen increased the apparent impact of positive events on PA and possibly of negative events on negative affect relative to placebo the findings confirm the utility of diary methods for studying drug effects on affective processes in normal elderly subjects they suggest that both metoclopramide and NAP can affect the associations between daily events and affects if replicated they would demonstrate that drug effects can extend beyond the intensity of affect andor the emergence of fullfledged psychiatric disorders to include moderation of the interactions between daily events and affect,66,placebo
13729151,previous studies revealed that extracellular regulated kinase and erk cascade plays pivotal roles in regulating oocyte meiotic Tc progression however most knowledge about the in vivo function of erk in rat oocytes was indirectly obtained from analyzing the phenotypes of mos KO in this T0 we knocked out erk and erk in mouse oocytes as early as the primordial follicle stage using the wellcharacterized gdfcre mouse model and for the first time directly investigated the in vivo CF of erk in mouse oocytes in this novel mouse MM we observed that erk MICs in oocyte are dispensable for primordial F2 maintenance activation and follicle growth different from the mos null oocytes the erkdeleted oocytes had wellassembled spindles at MI mi extruded PB pb with normal sizes and did not undergo a full parthenogenetic activation characterized for pronuclear formation however the ovulated erkdeleted oocytes had poorlyassembled metaphase ii mii spindles spontaneously released PB pb and were arrested at another metaphase called metaphase iii miii in addition erk deletion prevented male PN formation after fertilization and caused female infertility in conclusion these results indicate that erk MICs are required for not only miiarrest maintenance but also efficient PN formation in mouse oocytes,118,metaphase i
11579509,we provide an overview of computational systems biology approaches as applied to the T0 of chemical and druginduced toxicity the concept of toxicity pathways is described in the context of the us national academies of science report toxicity testing in the st century a vision and a strategy pathway mapping and modeling based on network biology concepts are a key component of the vision laid out in this report for a more biologically based analysis of doseresponse SMB and the safety of chemicals and drugs we focus on toxicity of the CL hepatotoxicity a complex phenotypic response with contributions from a number of different cell types and biological processes we describe three case studies of complementary multiscale computational modeling approaches to understand perturbation of toxicity pathways in the human liver as a result of exposure to environmental contaminants and specific drugs one RPA involves OD of a spatial multicellular virtual tissue MM of the liver lobule that combines molecular circuits in individual HCs with cellcell interactions and bloodmediated transport of toxicants through hepatic sinusoids to enable quantitative mechanistic prediction of hepatic DR for activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor toxicity pathway simultaneously methods are being developing to extract quantitative maps of intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks perturbed by environmental contaminants using a combination of gene expression and genomewide proteindna interaction data a predictive physiological model dilisymÃ¢Â„Â¢ to understand druginduced CL injury dili the most common adverse event leading to termination of clinical development programs and RII actions on drugs is also described the MM initially focuses on reactive metaboliteinduced dili in response to administration of acetaminophen and spans multiple biological scales,91,liver
11043287,this T0 investigated whether perinatal SE to diuron DCMU might exert adverse effects on rat lymphoid organs pregnant spraguedawley sd rats were exposed to diuron at or ppm in the diet from gestational days gd and during lactation at postnatal day pnd male pups were euthanized and thymus SP mesenteric lymph node and femur were collected for histopathological analysis food consumption and body weight gain were significantly reduced in dams exposed to ppm during gestation period also diuron at and ppm produced increased relative spleen weight associated histologically with severe congestion in red pulp enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis and hemosiderosis as well as depletion of lymphoid follicles in WG pulp flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant reduction in b lymphocytes cdra in male pups but t lymphocytes cd cd and cdcd were not markedly affected thus data suggest that diuroninduced maternal toxicity in dams exposed to high dose and perinatal SE to this herbicide produced spleen toxicity as evidenced by a reduction in b lymphocyte number in male sd pups,48,spleen
7248587,we evaluated whether there is a possible relationship between the effectiveness of gammaglobulin treatment for patients with kawasaki disease kd and the polymorphism of fcgamma riia iiib and iiia genomic dna was extracted from whole blood collected from patients with kd who received gammaglobulin treatment the genotypes for fcgamma riiibna fcgamma riiahr and fcgammariiiafv were determined to investigate the association between these polymorphisms and the OD of coronary lesions cals twentythree percent of patients with the hh S2 for the fcgamma riia polymorphism progressed to cals compared with with the hr and rr alleles hr and rr alleles may be a predictor of the progression of cals in kd before the initiation of gammaglobulin therapy,77,allele
5681650,this T0 investigated the penetrability of dentinal tubules in cavity walls lined with different DBS occlusal class i cavities were prepared in premolars the cavities in the control group had an intact smear SL without a lining while those in the experimental group were lined with gluma cps scotchbond multipurpose plus or OS the penetrability of the dentinal tubules was tested with a dye basic fuchsin or bacteria s faecalis immediately after adhesive lining and T3 onemonth storage in water at degrees c some of the lined samples were sectioned and examined under the sem in some samples in the EG the dye penetrated to the pulp and bacteria up to microm into the dentinal tubules immediately after lining the kruskal wallis anova and tukey test showed the depth of dye and bacterial penetration to be significantly less in teeth with bonding systems than those in the control group p however there was no statistically significant difference between the control and exp groups after storage in water p sem examination showed that the hybrid SL and resin tags were present in the cavity walls immediately after lining but absent T3 storage in water therefore adhesive linings under the exp conditions were ineffective in preventing dye or bacterial penetration of the dentinal tubules,100,experimental group
4100285,this T0 was designed to test the hypothesis that brcamp and brcgmp dependent EC50 of phorbol dibutyrate stimulated contractions of IN rat aorta are independent of changes in the level of myosin light chain phosphorylation phorbol dibutyrate stimulated contraction with a concomitant increase in myosin CS chain phosphorylation in normal tissues and without an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation in calciumdepleted tissues phorbol dibutyrate stimulated contractions in normal caclcontaining PSS were relaxed in a concentrationdependent manner by brcamp and brcgmp phorbol dibutyrateinduced contractions in the absence of ca were only relaxed by brcgmp brcamp had no effect the relaxation induced by brcgmp was associated with a decrease in MLCP suggesting that cgmpdependent protein kinase may alter the activity of either the S1 CS chain kinase or phosphatase the relaxation induced by brcamp was not associated with a decrease in phosphorylation suggesting that campdependent protein kinase may uncouple myosin light chain phosphorylation from force,122,myosin
840766,in this T0 circulating concentrations of intermediary metabolites were measured in eight nonobese subjects with motor neurone disease in the basal postabsorptive state and after a g oral gl challenge eight healthy subjects of similar age and body mass index served as controls basal Pyr concentration was significantly elevated in the subjects with MND p less than after oral gl ingestion overall levels of Pyr p less than and lactate p less than were significantly higher in these subjects blood glucose concentrations fulfilled the criteria diagnostic of impaired glucose tolerance in six of the eight subjects with motor neurone disease who cumulative insulin levels were slightly higher in these subjects and peak insulin response was delayed min vs min relative to the HCs circulating concentrations of alanine glycerol nonesterified fatty acids and total ketone bodies were similar between groups these results confirm that IGT is a common feature of motor neurone disease furthermore our data indicate disordered regulation of both pyruvate and lactate metabolism consistent with reports of defective skeletal muscle Pyr oxidation in individuals with this disorder in contrast our results indicate that the regulation of lipolysis and ketone body metabolism is unimpaired in MND,64,pyruvate
9787186,in the present T0 we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of acetyllcarnitine alc administration on mitochondrial dysfunction following tenth thoracic level contusion spinal cord injury sci in rats initial results from experiments in vitro with naÃƒÂ¯ve mitochondria showed that in the absence of Pyr alc can be used as an alternative ATP for mitochondrial QO2 additionally when added in vitro to mitochondria isolated from h injured cords alc restored respiration rates to normal C2 for administration studies in vivo injured rats were given ip i.v. of saline VH or alc mgkg at or min postinjury followed by one booster after h mitochondria were isolated h postinjury and assessed for QO2 rates activities of ND cytochrome c oxidase and Pyr dehydrogenase sci significantly p decreased respiration rates and activities of all enzyme complexes but alc treatment significantly p maintained mitochondrial QO2 and enzyme activities compared with vehicle treatment critically alc administration in vivo at min and h postinjury versus vehicle followed once daily for days significantly p spared GM in summary alc treatment maintains mitochondrial bioenergetics following contusion sci and thus holds great potential as a neuroprotective therapy for acute sci,138,respiration
2819328,the ability of s aureus to resist phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmn is thought to be an important VF for this microorganism we have studied the effect of L1 cell wall components of s aureus PGN protein a and teichoic acid on pmn function phagocytosis and CTX were both inhibited by prior incubation of pmn with PGN this effect was dose and timerelated incubation with as little as microgramsml for min produced a discernible suppressive effect suppression of pmn CF was independent of the presence of human serum but was abolished by rb AS to peptidoglycan addition of PGN to pmn stimulated a prolonged CL response that was greater when the peptidoglycan was first incubated in normal SS perhaps reflection opsonization of this particulate material although protein a also suppressed phagocytic and chemotactic capabilities of pmn this effect was observed only in the presence of serum and was eliminated by absorbing ig centrifugation of the SS protein a mixture showed that the suppressive effect was contained in the precipitated sediment complexes of ig CT were not suppressive teichoic acid in concentrations less than or equal to microgramsml had no adverse effect on pmn function these studies describe ways in which peptidoglycan and protein a may interfere with phagocytosis and chemotaxis of human pmn thus giving evidence for the role of these cell wall components as virulence factors,56,peptidoglycan
1070463,we studied the effects of selective chronic dietary sodium chloride or KD in young rats on vasopressin mrna levels in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei an index of vasopressin formation and in plasma vasopressin C2 an index of vasopressin PR all diets significantly increased plasma renin activity contracted the ECF volume and decreased SS osmolarity in the SO vasopressin mrna levels were significantly decreased in the lowsodium group but were not significantly affected by chloride SD there were no significant changes in vasopressin mrna in the paraventricular nucleus after sodium or chloride dietary SD after weeks of KD vasopressin mrna C2 were decreased in the supraoptic nucleus when KD was prolonged for weeks vasopressin mrna levels increased in both supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei plasma vasopressin levels were high in animals subjected to dietary chloride SD or to weeks of KD dietary sodium depletion or weeks of dietary KD did not significantly affect plasma vasopressin our results show that chronic sodium chloride or KD differentially affect BB vasopressin mrna and vasopressin PR in young rats the effect of these diets may be mediated through changes in the extracellular fluid volume serum osmolarity andor renin angiotensin system,49,extracellular fluid
6030515,in an effort to prevent degeneration of articular cartilage associated with meniscectomies both meniscal allografts and synthetic replacements are subjects of current interest and investigation the objectives of the current study were to determine whether a transversely isotropic linearly elastic homogeneous material model of the meniscal tissue is necessary to achieve a normal contact pressure CSD on the tibial plateau determine which material and boundary condition attachments parameters affect the contact pressure distribution most strongly and set tolerances on these parameters to restore the contact pressure distribution to within a specified error to satisfy these objectives a finite PE MM of the TF joint of a human CAD knee including both menisci was used to study the contact pressure distribution on the tibial plateau to validate the MM the contact pressure distribution on the tibial plateau was measured experimentally in the same knee used to create the model within physiologically reasonable bounds on five material parameters and four attachment parameters associated with a meniscal replacement an optimization was performed under n of compressive load on the set of nine parameters to minimize the difference between the exp and MM results the error between the experimental and MM contact variables was minimized to the contact pressure distribution of the tibial plateau was sensitive to the circumferential modulus axialradial modulus and horn stiffness but relatively insensitive to the remaining six parameters consequently both the circumferential and axialradial moduli are important determinants of the contact pressure distribution and hence should be matched in the design andor selection of meniscal replacements in addition during surgical implantation of a meniscal replacement the horns should be attached with high stiffness bone plugs and the attachments of the transverse ligament and deep medial collateral AL should be restored to minimize changes in the contact pressure distribution and thereby possibly prevent the degradation of AC,306,articular cartilage

10102932,previous studies have shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors hdacis can kill cancer cells in addition hdacis can induce mitotic catastrophe in CA cells due to insufficient localization of chromosomal passenger complex cpc to the CEN however the mechanisms behind these phenomena remain unclear in this T0 we found that a hdaci fk affected multiple epigenetic modification characteristics of the CEN including enhanced acetylation of histone h lysine hk decreased trimethylation of hk and decreased phosphorylation of histone h serine HS and CEN protein a cenpa these epigenetic changes implied that hk hyperacetylation inhibits the cpc recruitment induces impaired centromere assembly and CF and eventually leads to aberrant mitosis these data suggested that hypoacetylation of histone in the pericentromere is the most important landmark for recruiting cpc and leading to the mitotic catastrophe in hdaciinduced killing of cancer cells,81,centromere
5956903,we report an association between a nonfamilial form of photosensitive lupusspecific skin disease subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus scle and a new single nucleotide polymorphism snp in the cqa gene we also describe an association between this snp and lower levels of serum cq this snp consists of adenine replacing the third guanine in the codon for AA residue gly position excludes the amino acid leading peptide that is located in the second exon of the cqa gene we have designated this snp cqaglygga the genbank CS at this location is cqaglyggg a survey of scle patients showed that were homozygous for cqaglygga snp seven were heterozygous and only one patient was homozygous for the genbank sequence in contrast only of normal controls were homozygous for the cqaglygga snp controls were heterozygous and eight controls were homozygous for the genbank CS thus the cqaglygga snp is strongly associated with scle pvalue by chisquare analysis with yates correction this snp would traditionally be classified as clinically silent as it does not encode a different CAA however our studies have suggested that this snp appears to be associated with a functional abnormality of cq expression since its presence correlates inversely with serum levels of cq antigenic protein in both scle patients and normal controls the mechanism by which this phenotypic NC is associated with the translationally silent synonymous clqaglygga genetic R2 is currently unknown,172,amino acid

9577643,we reported recently that amphiphilic polymers can be assembled at interfaces created between aqueous phases and thermotropic liquid crystals lcs in ways that i couple the organization of the polymer to the order of the lc and ii respond to changes in the properties of aqueous phases that can be characterized as changes in the optical appearance of the lc this investigation sought to characterize the behavior of aqueouslc interfaces decorated with uniaxially compressed thin films of polymers transferred by langmuirschaefer ls transfer here we report physicochemical characterization of interfaces created between AQ phases and the thermotropic lc cyanopentylbiphenyl B6 decorated with langmuir films of a novel amphiphilic CP CP synthesized by the addition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to polyvinyldimethylazlactone initial characterization of this system resulted in the unexpected observation of uniform azimuthal alignment of cb T3 ls transfer of the CP films to aqueouscb interfaces this paper describes characterization of langmuir films of CP hosted at aqueouscb interfaces as well as the results of our investigations into the origins of the uniform ordering of the lc observed upon ls transfer our results when con the bile differs entirely from that of the ducts the one organ acting to concentrate the secretion markedly and the other to dilute it slightly the question arises in species lacking a gall bladder whether the concentrating function of this organ will be found lodged in the ducts to test the point observations have been made upon the mouse and rat since these animals though so nearly related have the mouse a gall bladder and the rat none the normal bile was first studied both animals were found to secrete larger quantities than do cats and dogs but less than the guinea pig and rb methods were worked out for the quantitation of the pigment which was used as the index to changes in concentration bladder bile of the mouse was regularly found to be more concentrated than that collected from the common duct of the same animal the bile collecting during stasis regularly showed a great increase in pigment content such as in other species is brought about by the action of the gall bladder in the rat on the other hand stasis bile never became more concentrated in pigment than the normal the gall bladder then is not only absent from the rat in form but in one at least of its important functions that its other obvious functionthat of a reservoircannot be assumed in the rat by the ducts would seem to be indicated not only by the small size of these channels but by the recent observation of mann that the tonus of the sphincter of oddi is almost negligible in the rat in contradistinction to animals which possess a gall bladder it is an interesting fact that the bile of the rat which as has been said undergoes no condensation of bulk T3 leaving the liver contains on the average eight times as much pigment as does the CL bile of the mouse which is submitted to concentration whether it is correspondingly strong in substances useful for digestion and therefore ab initio requires no concentration is a matter upon which little can be said at present however in this connection the fact that the bulk of bile secreted per gram of CL weight is MZ in both animals may be significant although this output is the same the mouse liver when compared with the body weight to is relatively larger than that of the rat to so that the mouse secretes somewhat more bile per gm of body weight this bile as it comes from the CL is but oneeighth as strong at least in pigment as rat bile but the concentrating activity of the gall bladder is so great that the products yielded to the intestine may become not dissimilar,108,polymer

12262113,this study focused on exploring the chromatographic characteristic of a homochiral mof cudcambpyn with d sixconnected selstmeristematic cotyledon mesophyll cells during the period of storage protein accumulation d T3 pollination showed that the rough er the GA and the developing vacuome are intimately involved in the formation of storage protein bodies aleurone bodies at the ON of storage protein accumulation d DAP storage proteinlike material appears within golgi vesicles and preformed vacuoles at a later stage d T3 pollination similar material can also be detected within vesicles formed directly by the rough endoplasmic reticulum er it is concluded that there are two routes for storage protein transport from its site of synthesis at the er to its site of accumulation in the vacuome the first route involves the participation of dictyosomes while the second route bypasses the golgi apparatus it appears that the normal pathways of membrane flow in the development of central vacuoles in postmeristematic cells are used to deposit the storage protein within the protein HB thus the protein body can be regarded as a transient stage in the process of vacuome OD of these storage cells,36,golgi apparatus
4915480,this T0 investigated the effects of quantity and type of diet fed to superovulated donor heifers on molecular and metabolic indices of embryonic development these effects included the relative abundances of mrnas for the alpha subunit of nakatpase and the antioxidant enzyme cuznsod as well as pyruvate utilization in bovine morulae and blastocysts developed in vivo heifers were fed a daily ration of either grass silage and a citrusbeet pulpbased concentrate or grass silage and a barleybased concentrate for days both at kg per day or ad libitum in embryos derived from heifers fed the pulpbased diets the relative abundances of the transcripts were not affected by either day of collection or quantity of diet in embryos derived from heifers fed the barleybased diets the relative abundances of the nakatpase transcripts were also not changed by these main effects while the relative abundances of the cuznsod transcripts were affected by day of collection and by the quantity of diet pyruvate metabolism was affected by day of collection and was significantly increased in day embryos compared with day and day embryos diet quantity did not affect Pyr utilization whereas diet type did increase pyruvate metabolism in the barley group when compared with the pulp group the results of this T0 show for the first time that molecular and metabolic variations may exist in embryos derived in vivo and developed in donor heifers on nutritional regimens differing in type and quantity differences in embryos collected on different developmental days may be attributed to varying cell numbers alterations in the relative abundances of the cuznsod transcripts and Pyr metabolism caused by the quantity of diet fed to the donor animal were likely to have been due to alterations in metabolic end products that accumulate in reproductive tract fluids whereas differences in embryonic metabolism caused by type of diet are related to the composition of the diet these findings characterize embryos produced in vivo at the molecular level indicating that the molecular markers used in the present T0 can differentiate between populations of embryos produced under different nutritional regimens and determine conditions conductive to the production of good quality embryos,185,pyruvate

2823155,this study was conducted to determine whether air distributed to the cerebral circulation alone could cause acute cardiovascular dysfunction and thus be a potential mechanism for SD following arterial air embolism cardiovascular measurements were made in anesthetized ventilated cats during infusion of air into a vertebral i.a. cerebral air embolism was found to induce an acute hypertensive response accompanied by severe cardiac arrhythmias interruption of the autonomic NS was found to abolish the cardiac arrhythmias but not to affect significantly the acute hypertensive response following CBF air embolism these results suggest that potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias can occur from air distributed solely to the cerebral circulation and that these arrhythmias are mediated by the ANS the results also indicate that acute hypertension can occur from CBF PAE but that this response is not solely mediated by the autonomic nervous system,114,autonomic nervous system
3051025,this study documents evolutionary modifications in the expression patterns of the sea urchin egf i and egf iii genes which encode a family of ECM the fibropellins we show that the sea urchin apical lamina a macromolecular EM that surrounds the sea urchin embryo and is made up of the fibropellins has been conserved through at least million years of echinoid evolution the contribution of different fibropellin family members to this structure has however changed over the course of sea urchin phylogeny and between two congeneric species that exhibit different developmental modes mapping the evolutionary history of the egf genes on a cladogram of relationships among sea urchins reveals that egf i is present in all echinoids examined while egf iii appears to have arisen by duplication and divergence from egf i during the radiation of a suborder of the camarodont sea urchins some million years ago alterations in the temporal expression patterns of these genes as well as the loss of one of the two egf i transcripts and encoded protein are coincident with the evolution of a directdeveloping larval form in heliocidaris erythrogramma h erythrogramma and its congener heliocidaris tuberculata which develops via a typical echinopluteus L3 shared a common ancestor about million years ago the differences in fibropellin representation within the apical lamina of the various taxa indicate that a homologous embryonic structure can undergo substantial changes in composition during its evolutionary history,198,larva

4869394,previous studies have led to the beliefs that STM is best during the night when the body temperature is at its nadir and that the circadian rhythms of STM and subjective alertness are driven by oscillators independent from each other and from the body temperature cycle unfortunately these conclusions which would have major implications for understanding the organization of the human circadian timing system are largely based on field and laboratory studies which in many cases sampled data infrequently andor limited data collection to normal waking hours in order to investigate these points further we have monitored behavioural variables in two different protocols under controlled laboratory conditions during a period of h of sustained wakefulness and during forced desynchrony between the body temperature and sleepwake cycles allowing testing of nonsleepdeprived subjects at all circadian phases contrary to earlier findings we report here that the CR of STM varies in parallel with the circadian rhythms of subjective alertness calculation performance and core body temperature under both these experimental conditions these results challenge the notion that ST SM is inversely linked to the body temperature cycle and suggest that the human circadian pacemaker which drives the body temperature cycle is the primary determinant of endogenous circadian variations in subjective alertness and calculation performance as well as in the immediate recall of meaningful material,144,circadian rhythm

12150919,it has been shown that amyloid ÃŽÂ² aÃŽÂ² secretion regulates cholesterol efflux from cells and that the eÃŽÂ´ osaka mutation in amyloid precursor protein app promotes intracellular accumulation of aÃŽÂ² and thus reduces its secretion these findings led us to speculate that app with the osaka mutation apposk might have a defect in cholesterol efflux and thus cause cellular malfunction we therefore examined the effects of this mutation on intracellular cholesterol transport and efflux in cultured cells upon cholesterol loading apposk expressing cells exhibited higher C2 of cellular cholesterol than wildtype appexpressing cells suggesting impaired cholesterol efflux it is known that after its internalization cholesterol is transported from the endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum er and GA and then to the plasma membrane in apposk expressing cells cholesterol accumulated with aÃŽÂ² in the er and golgi apparatus and CT in endosomeslysosomes these results imply that the mutationinduced disturbance of aÃŽÂ² trafficking from the er to the plasma membrane affects cholesterol transport to cause cholesterol accumulation in the er and GA and consequently in endosomes furthermore we detected an enhanced mitochondrial accumulation of aÃŽÂ² and cholesterol in apposk expressing cells and this was accompanied by an increase in the generation of ROS species ros the present findings suggest that aÃŽÂ² trafficking is important for intracellular cholesterol transport and efflux and that the osaka mutation potentiates cholesteroldependent exacerbation of intracellular aÃŽÂ² toxicity ie aÃŽÂ²induced ros generation by disturbing aÃŽÂ²mediated cholesterol efflux from the cell,116,golgi apparatus

10062932,we investigated the link between cell movement and BPM recycling using a fastacting temperaturesensitive mutant of the dictyostelium seca exocytic protein strikingly most mutant cells become almost paralysed within T2 at the restrictive temperature however they can still sense cyclicamp camp gradients and polymerise actin upgradient but form only abortive pseudopodia which cannot expand they also relay a camp signal normally suggesting that camp is released by a nonexocytic mechanism to investigate why seca is required for motility we examined membrane trafficking in the mutant BPM circulation is rapidly inhibited at the restrictive temperature and the cells acquire a prominent vesicle organellespecific markers show that this is an undischarged contractile vacuole and we found the cells are correspondingly osmosensitive electron microscopy shows that many smaller vesicles probably originating from the plasma membrane also accumulate at the restrictive temperature consistent with this the SA of mutant cells shrinks we suggest that seca mutant cells cannot move at the restrictive temperature because their block in exocytosis results in a net uptake of plasma membrane reducing its area and so restricting pseudopodial expansion this demonstrates the importance of proper SA regulation in cell movement,85,plasma membrane
10177029,a novel oligonucleotide carrier which can scavenge ros is described the synthesized VG CP is composed of a peg segment and a tempocontaining hydrophobic segment for scavenging ros this graft polymer can form a pic through electrostatic interaction with oligonucleotides such as sirna the amount of ros was monitored by fluorescence measurements using hÃ¢Â‚Â‚ dcfda as a probe and it was confirmed that the ros level was effectively suppressed the cellular uptake of pic containing the fluorescencelabeled oligonucleotide was evaluated by FM delivered sirna suppressed the expression of the mrna the prepared graft copolymer is thus a promising candidate as a novel oligonucleotide carrier which also reduces ros damage generated by cationic CP carriers,13,polymer

11930283,this paper reports solutionprocessed highefficiency polymer lightemitting diodes fabricated by a new type of rolltoroll coating method under AA conditions a noble rolltoroll cohesive coating system utilizes only NK gravity and the surface tension of the solution to flow out from the capillary to the surface of the ATP because this mechanism uses a minimally cohesive solution the rolltoroll cohesive coating can effectively realize an ultrathin film thickness for the electron injection layer in addition the rolltoroll cohesive coating enables the fabrication of a thicker CP anode film more than nm at one time by modification of the surface energy and without wasting the solution it is observed that the standard sheet resistance deviation of the polymer anode is only ÃÂ‰Ã¢Â–Â¡ over bending cycles the standard sheet resistance deviation of the polymer anode in the different bending angles to Ã‚Â° is ÃÂ‰Ã¢Â–Â¡ but the case of the itopet is ÃÂ‰Ã¢Â–Â¡ the average surface roughness of the CP anode measured by atomic force microscopy is only nm because the surface of the CP anode has a better SQ the leakage current of the polymer lightemitting diodes pleds using the polymer anode is much lower than that using the itopet substrate the luminous power efficiency of the two devices is lmw for the CP anode and lmw for the itopet consequently the pleds made by using the polymer anode exhibited enhanced performance because the polymer anode represents not only a higher transparency than the itopet in the wavelength of nm but also greatly reduced roughness the optimized the maximum current efficiency and SP efficiency of the device show around cda and lmw respectively which is comparable to the case of using the itoglass,171,polymer
507040,we previously showed that the initial acquisition session of a spatial discrimination mixed referenceworking SM test in an arm radial maze induced differential activations in the ascending ACh septohippocampal and nbmcortical pathways in mice this data showed that the duration of posttest ACh activation was longer in the nbmcortical pathway than in the septohippocampal projection moreover the posttest durations but not the immediate posttest amplitudes of activation in each pathway decreased progressively as a CF of repeated daily acquisition sessions in the present T0 we have thus tested the hypotheses that the timecourses of posttest ACh activation in the septohippocampal and nbmcortical pathways may vary both as a function of the type of SM used working vs reference and according to the duration of repeated daily testing cholinergic activity in vivo in the hippocampus or frontal cortex of mice was quantified using measures of sodiumdependent highaffinity choline uptake at two different times s and min following TPS spatial working or REF memory testing in an arm radial maze the SM tests were po daily over a day period to attain high C2 of performance in each type of task in comparison to control groups both types of SM testing induced significant posttest ACh activations in each BB region on day however ACh activity remained elevated in FC cortex at min posttest following REF memory testing whereas significantly shorter durations of cortical and HPC ACh activation were observed following working memory testing using short min retention intervals the possible significance of these differential modifications to the timecourse of the posttest activations in these ACh pathways in working and REF memory processes and the putative transsynaptic mechanisms involved are discussed,211,cholinergic

9867621,in an attempt to understand the complex RII mechanisms underlying sucroseinduced flavonoid biosynthesis we examined several arabidopsis mutants with altered anthocyanin accumulation we determined that disruption of ethylene signaling results in a dramatic increase in sucroseinduced anthocyanin accumulation furthermore we investigated why the ein ethylene insensitive arabidopsis mutant accumulates higher C2 of anthocyanin in response to SU than wildtype arabidopsis an increased level of pap transcript in the ein mutant appears to be the main factor responsible for the increased accumulation of anthocyanin in response to SU therefore our results indicate that the DDE signaling pathway plays a negative role in sucroseinduced anthocyanin accumulation we believe that the explanation for this observation may be related to the initiation of the senescence program in plants,86,sucrose

3394201,a method has been developed to calculate the forces that are developed in the ligaments of a joint specimen during motions this indirect method is needed since direct measurements fail in the case of small ligaments as an example the small ligaments of the carpal joint are considered the rationale of the method is that the force generated in a AL depends on the amount of CS to which it is subjected and on its material characteristics in the method presented the lengths of the ligaments are determined in vitro at several joint positions by means of rÃƒÂ¶ntgenstereophotogrammetry the zeroforce length and the forceelongation relationship are determined on the same ligaments isolated in a materials testing machine over a considerable part of the strain range the measurement PE are relatively small compared to the forces determined less than the method is applicable to joints in situations where other measuring methods cannot be used the present analysis shows however that the force values determined are susceptible to preconditioning of the ligaments in preconditioned ligaments the forces could be up to lower than in the nonpreconditioned situation this suggests that AL forces may vary considerably in vivo depending on the extent of preconditioning provoked by a particular CF,188,ligament

5834876,the aim of this study was to investigate whether the ligamentous lumbar vertebral column of a macaque could potentially provide passive mechanical support to the weight of the head upper body and forelimbs during upright sitting the seated flexed curvature of the lumbar spine of macaca sylvana was estimated from a photograph and was partitioned equally among the lumbarlumbar intervertebral joints this flexed curvature was compared with the hyperextended profile of the unloaded excised ligamentous spine of a related species macaca fascicularis and used to calculate changes in intervertebral angle from the unloaded excised state to the loaded in vivo state changes in intervertebral angle were then used to calculate the net flexion moment required to bend the spine from the unloaded curvature to the seated curvature the moment arm of the ventrally displaced weight of the head UB and forelimbs was estimated and used to calculate a corresponding net force it was found that this force corresponded to approximately of the total body weight of the kg sample animal this compares with a likely fractional body weight of approximately for the head UB and forelimbs of these primates therefore approximately half of the VP flexion moment associated with the combined weight of the head upper body and forelimbs during sitting in these animals may be supported by the passive mechanical properties associated with the ligamentous lumbar spine this represents a potential means of relieving muscular effort and saving metabolic energy,194,ventral
9178482,we experienced two autopsy cases of unexpected death during surgical operation case was a yearold male salvage esophagectomy was performed from the RA side of the thrax T3 dissection of the CL node blood pressure decreased suddenly emergency thoracotomy was done for diffuse hemothorax in the left thoracic cavity the patient died despite aggressive hemostasis autopsy findings revealed that the operator dissected the left subclavian i.a. instead of the lymph NO case was a yearold male with T3 thyroid cancer with pelvic metastasis surgical removal of the sacrum was attempted for pain relief the T0 was interrupted because of massive hemorrhage from the iliac veins T3 the operation the patients left leg quickly became necrotic despite the bypass grafting from the RA to the left FA artery the patient died of RI autopsy revealed ligation of the left common iliac artery along with the accompanying vein the leg necrosis was thought to have resulted from the vascular ligation in these two cases the demonstration and elucidation of the causes of deaths were required with medicolegal autopsies however it proved difficult to visualize the operated vessels in detail in autopsy investigations related to surgical operations detailed information of the clinical course is valuable and should be provided by the operators themselves as well as being obtained from clinical charts,31,lymph
8352979,a novel phosphate solubilizing bacterium psb was isolated from the rhizosphere of sugarcane and is capable of utilizing SU and rock phosphate as the sole carbon and phosphate source respectively this psb exhibited mineral phosphate solubilizing mps phenotype on sugars such as sucrose and fructose which are not substrates for enzyme glucose dehydrogenase gdh along with gdh substrates viz glucose xylose and maltose as carbon sources pcr amplification of the rrna gene and sequence analysis identified this bacterium as citrobacter sp dhrss on sucrose and fructose citrobacter sp dhrss liberated and microm free phosphate from rock phosphate and secreted mm gl and mm gl acetic acid respectively growth of citrobacter sp dhrss on SU is mediated by an intracellular inducible neutral invertase interestingly in the presence of gdh substrates like glucose and maltose citrobacter sp dhrss produced approximately mm gl gluconic acid and phosphate released was and microm respectively citrobacter sp dhrss gdh activity was found when grown on gdh and nongdh substrates indicating that it is constitutive and could act on a wide range of aldose sugars this T0 demonstrates the role of different organic acids in mineral phosphate CMS by rhizobacteria depending on the nature of the available carbon source,18,sucrose
6033175,we examined the effects of specific inhibitors brefeldin a bfa and okadaic acid oa on the ultrastructural organization of the GA and distributions of amylase golgiassociated proteins and cat d in the rat parotid acinar cells bfa induced a rapid regression of the golgi stack into rudimentary golgi clusters composed of tubulovesicules in parallel with a RD of the golgiresident proteins and a CP betacop into the region of the Rg endoplasmic reticulum rer or cytosol the rapid disruption of the golgi stack could also be induced by the effect of oa however redistribution of the golgi proteins in rer or cytosol could not be observed and betacop was not dispersed but was retained on the rudimentary golgi apparatus these findings suggested that the mechanism of oa in inducing degeneration of the golgi stack was markedly different from that of bfa in addition missorting of amylase a golgi protein and cat d into incorrect transport pathways is apparent in the course of the disruption of the golgi stack by oa these golgidisrupting effects are reversible and the reconstruction of the stacked structure of the GA started immediately T3 the removal of inhibitors in the REC processes missorting was also observed until the integrated structure of the GA was completely reconstructed this suggested that the integrated structure of the golgi apparatus was quite necessary for the occurrence of normal secretory events including proper sorting of molecules,20,golgi apparatus
716139,this study investigates the interaction of hormones and the CSK within the apical cytoplasm of uterine epithelial cells of the rat the effects of the hormones estradiol beta and progesterone on the MF configuration were studied using S1 subfragment s decoration of actin microfilaments mf and transmission electron microscopy in control ovariectomized animals a sparse mf distribution was found in the apical cytoplasm underlying short MV with sdecorated core mf hormone treatment experiments consisted of injecting OVX with either progesterone or estradiol beta for the T0 of the mf configuration accompanying an apical surface primed for blastocyst receptivity progesterone treatment was immediately followed by a single dose of estradiol beta the long regular microvilli associated with estradiol only treatment contained bundled decorated mf with tightly bundled rootlets progesterone CT produced numerous short microvilli with decorated core bundle mf and pronounced rootlets that frequently appeared splayed the irregular microvilli and luminal surface of the uterine epithelial cells associated with the receptivity hormone sequence contained variable mf configurations including mf bundles networks and Az with a felted appearance the results show that the various hormone regimes produce characteristically different mf configurations and that this component of the CSK appears to be under the control of a delicate hormone balance within these uterine cells the responses of uterine mf to specific regimes of steroid hormones used in this T0 are not only important for the understanding of the mechanisms at work during early pregnancy but also contribute to the body of knowledge concerning the ways in which hormones in GA effect the cytoskeleton of target cells,32,microfilament
7883603,the ability to connect to the actin cytoskeleton is a key part of the adhesive function of integrins this linkage between integrins and the CSK involves a C1 complex of integrinassociated proteins that CF in both the assembly and disassembly of the link genetic evidence has helped to clarify the relative contributions of different components of this link in different contexts integrins can either stimulate or suppress actin based structures indicating the variety of pathways leading from integrins to the CSK the CSK also contributes to the extent of the integrin junction allowing an adhesive contact to attain sufficient strength to resist contractile forces involved in cellular movement and function,82,cytoskeleton

6573876,the aim of the present T0 was to cephalometrically compare pharyngeal changes between upright and supine positions in patients with upper airway resistance syndrome uars or OSA osa eightytwo osa patients men mean age years and women years underwent cephalometric sleep apnoea analysis one upright and one supine radiograph were taken of each patient a total of cephalometric radiographs the results showed no significant changes either in naso or hypopharyngeal soft tissues between the two positions in contrast the shortest distance from the soft palate veve and the tip of the soft palate uu to the posterior oropharyngeal wall was significantly narrower p in the supine position furthermore in the SP a slight thickening in the soft palate spsp p was detected with no change in the length of the soft palate pnsu the form of the tongue changed significantly it was shorter tttgo p ttva p and thicker tstttgo p in the supine position the present results suggest that osa patients are prone to significant narrowing of their OP but not of their naso or hypopharyngeal airways in the SP thus treatment of osa and uars patients should mainly be aimed at preventing further oropharyngeal airway narrowing as a result of supinedependent sleep,110,supine position
3677334,to determine the ability of prophylactic knee braces to reduce or limit medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligament elongation under dynamic loading conditions we used CAD specimens that had a surrogate soft tissue material that matched the tissue compliance of in vivo contracted muscles eight cadaveric specimens were fitted with four prophylactic knee braces and instrumented with hall effect CS transducers on both the medial collateral and anterior cruciate AL each specimen was mounted in a testing frame while a lateral impact was applied to the knee joint by a pendulum at levels below the injury threshold legs were tested at degrees and degrees of knee flexion both with and without an intact anterior cruciate AL the maximum elongation for each AL was calculated as a percentage of the initial measured length the addition of a prophylactic knee brace significantly reduced the level of impact force at the point of impact but this did not result in a significant reduction of ACL ligament elongation for any test although not significant all braces tested were more effective at reducing medial collateral AL elongation during a lateral impact with the knee flexion at degrees than at degrees,121,ligament

2224127,this study describes the presence of a receptor for fluid phase human c and cb on raji cell membranes the IB of c and cb was demonstrated indirectly by a fluoresceinated antic SS and directly by using radioiodinated proteins no other complement proteins or serum AF were needed to mediate IB of c and B6 to the receptor the possibility of enzymatic cleavage of c before or T3 its attachment on the CM was ruled out by the demonstration of antigenically IN c on raji cells inhibition and dissociation of raji celleac rosettes by c and B6 indicated that both of these proteins bind to the same receptor site or closely associated receptor sites on raji cells cbbearing raji cells were IA negative indicating that cb IB to the receptor is brought about through the IA region of the molecule and not the cd portion the c receptor on raji cell membranes is uniformly distributed and can move on the membrane plane approximately x molecules of c or cb bind per raji cell the receptor had a higher affinity for c than cb as was shown by uptake experiments and inhibition of raji celleac rosette formation apart from the described receptor for c and B6 another specific receptor for B6 inactivatorcleaved cb cd bound to CRC was shown to be present on raji cells raji cells cultured in medium containing fresh NHS and cobra venom factor were lysed similar results were obtained when cbbearing raji cells were cultured in medium with fresh normal human SS the lytic effect could be abolished by inactivating SS c proactivator cpa and required c it was concluded that B6 bound to the raji CM activates the complement system through the alternate pathway and results in membrane damage and cytolysis it is postulated that cell destruction by this mechanism may play an important role in vivo in controlling cell growth,279,cell membrane
5454394,in this study we investigated the distribution of the standard form of the cd cds cell adhesion molecule and of its v and v isoforms in samples of foetal and adult PG tissue in comparison with samples of PG adenomas and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma foetal parotid gland showed cds and cdv expression in the IP small primordial ducts and acini while cdv was only focally expressed AD parotid gland tissue showed a similar CSD of cds and SCV with a predominant expression in acinar structures and a weaker expression at duct level in PG adenomas a diffuse and intense expression of cds and SCV and was observed only in pleomorphic adenomas while expression of cds was prevalent in warthins tumour myoepithelioma and oncocytoma the malignant areas of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma showed a markedly decreased expression of cdv and cdv in comparison with the adjacent pleomorphic adenoma component in conclusion the prevalent expression of cds and variants in pleomorphic adenoma in comparison with other adenomas may be related to the abundant EM production present in these tumours while loss of cdv and cdv associated with the onset of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma could promote stromal invasion eventually contributing to the OD of distant metastases,94,parotid gland

3583901,we reported previously that a reorganization of microfilaments can be observed when macrophages are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide lps this reorganization is not detected with current methods in macrophages of an lpsnonresponsive C3 mouse these results suggest that the observed MF response might be involved in a macrophageactivating process induced by lps to investigate this we studied the effect of cytochalasin d cd which inhibits reorganization of microfilaments on lpsinduced TN factor tnf production a concentration of cd incapable of affecting filamentous actin by itself was used in these experiments when this concentration of cd was added T3 lps stimulation MF reorganization and tnf production were inhibited the suppressive effect of cd on tnf production was confirmed by the observation that tnfalpha mrna expression was also inhibited by cd this GABA effect of cd was not specific to tnf because the production of interleukin and prostaglandin e were also inhibited these effects of cd were observed only when cd was added within the first min T3 lps stimulation these results suggest that the cdsensitive MF response is essential in the signaling pathway for the production of certain monokines in lpsstimulated macrophages,173,microfilament
7609210,a novel SO has been identified from thermus thermophilus at despite this enzyme showing significant aminoacid sequence homology to several bacterial and eukaryal putative and identified sulfite oxidases the kinetic analysis performed following the oxidation of sulfite and with ferricyanide as the QA already pointed out major differences from representatives of bacterial and eukaryal sources sulfite oxidase from t thermophilus purified to homogeneity is a monomeric enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of kda and is almost exclusively located in the periplasm fraction the enzyme showed sulfite oxidase activity only when ferricyanide was used as electron acceptor which is different from most of sulfiteoxidizing enzymes from several sources that use cytochrome c as cosubstrate spectroscopic studies demonstrated that the purified sulfite oxidase has no cytochrome like domain normally present in rat enzymes from eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources and for this particular feature it is similar to rat enzyme from arabidopsis thaliana the identified gene was pcr amplified on t thermophilus at genome expressed in escherichia coli and the recombinant protein identified and characterized,42,electron acceptor
3588132,the aim of the present study was to assess the heterogeneity of cumulus cells that occurs in human cumuli associated with oviductal oocytes and fertilized eggs transmission electron microscopy was used to study the cumulus masses surrounding both unfertilized oocytes and fertilized eggs a pronuclear and a cell stage recovered at different intervals after ovulation the specimens were obtained by flushing the oviducts of normal cycling women who underwent surgical sterilization the cumuli were expanded due to large and irregular ICS small linear gap junctions were seen at cell contacts whereas annular gap junctions were found only in the cytoplasm of some cells both types of junction were less abundant in fertilized specimens cells surrounding fertilized eggs projected numerous long thin microvilli into the intercellular spaces as a rule the inner layer of the cumulus mass corona cells was composed of cells whose surface was relatively smooth cumulus cells showed oval nuclei with one or more nucleoli the cytoplasm of most cells possessed abundant organelles typical of steroidosynthesis i mitochondria with tubular or villiform cristae ii a welldeveloped smooth endoplasmic reticulum and iii electron dense lipid droplets often surrounded by a few concentric CM of SER andor in close contact with MTs and microfilaments microperoxisomelike structures were also present T3 fertilization an enhancement of the steroidosynthetic characteristics occurred in the outer layers of the cumulus mass but not in the corona cells which still appeared capable of protidosynthesis together these morphological features support the hypothesis that the cumulus of oviductal oocytes and particularly of fertilized eggs luteinizes like parietal GCs generating a steroid hormonal microenvironment in the oviduct which may affect fertilization and zygote segmentation cumulus cells showing spermiophagic activity as well as G1 macrophages leukocytes and red blood cells were also found in the cumulus mass the macrophages may play a local role both by phagocytic activity and by modulating the steroid secretion of the neighbouring cumulus cells which occurs in the ovarian F2 and CL in conclusion the cumulus mass surrounding tubal oocytes and fertilized eggs appears to be a heterogeneous and dynamic system in which the microenvironment for fertilization and early embryo OD is provided by diverse cell populations in addition to the oviductal cells,195,smooth endoplasmic reticulum
11985632,the ability to control premrna splicing with small molecules could facilitate the development of therapeutics or cellbased circuits that control gene CF myotonic dystrophy type is caused by the dysregulation of alternative premrna splicing due to sequestration of muscleblindlike protein mbnl by expanded noncoding rcug repeats rcugexp here we report two small molecules that induce or ameliorate alternative splicing dysregulation a thiophenecontaining small molecule inhibits the interaction of mbnl with its NK premrna substrates compound a substituted naphthyridine binds rcugexp and displaces mbnl structural models show that binds mbnl in the znfinger domain and that interacts with uu loops in rcugexp this study provides a structural FR for small molecules that target mbnl by mimicking rcugexp and shows that targeting mbnl causes dysregulation of AS suggesting that mbnl is thus not a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type,124,alternative splicing
5310596,this T0 investigated the effect of water storage of fiberreinforced composite on the adhesion of streptococcus mutans s mutans and its ability to stay adhered and multiply on the frc the materials eglass SF and denture base CP were stored in water for or days or left dry water contact angles of the materials before and T3 water storage were determined test specimens with or without parotid saliva or serum pellicle were incubated in a suspension of s mutans allowing initial adhesion to occur bacterial adhesion and multiplication was studied using scanning electron microscopy contact angles of both materials were significantly reduced after water storage indicating an increase in SFE when studied without a surface pellicle water storage significantly increased adhesion of s mutans to both glass and polymer saliva coating of the materials resulted in higher degree of adhesion to glass fibers in comparison with CP and T3 days water storage glass bound over twice as much s mutans cells than the polymer matrix bacterial growth and biofilm formation occurred equally on both materials the results of this in vitro T0 suggest that in order to avoid the possible increase in s mutans adhesion the reinforcing glass fibers should be covered with the matrix CP of the composite,205,polymer

3367020,this paper reports the experiments in which tripynadine free base at a dose times that of ed was given to mice by i.g. administration on the th day following the administration the mice were inoculated with x rbc INF with Pb anka CS the infection rate was zero implying that all mice had acquired protection although the residual activity time of tripynadine phosphate was longer than that of tripynadine free base or piperaquine phosphate but tripynadine phosphate caused vomiting in monkeys during the medication the residual antimalarial activity of tripynadine hydroxynaphthoate was less than that of tripynadine phosphate or tripynadlles ie RER rer and the GA in je virusinfected pc cells was analyzed by EM observation starting h postinoculation pi a structure that represented nascent rer appeared in the cytoplasm in the form of rows of ribosomes which surrounded membraneunbounded electronlucent lacunae in a reticular honeycomb pattern reticular rer although the Rt rer lacked membrane components its lacunae contained progeny virions indicating that the rows of ribosomes synthesized the viral proteins and discharged them into the lacunae for the viral assembly the Rt rer apparently transformed into the familiar lamellar rer during the rer morphogenesis as the lacunae coalesced to form flat cisternae and rer membrane assembled to border the cisternae these findings indicated that the proliferating rer was the site of not only AS protein synthesis but also AS membrane biogenesis the proliferating rer released a large number of membrane LDV including virioncarrying vesicles into the cytoplasm these vesicles congregated in the juxtanuclear region especially around the centrioles and fused to existing golgi complexes for enlargement or fused among themselves to form new golgi complexes the present study therefore indicated that a nascent rer was formed by polysomes that arranged themselves in rows of ribosomes without participation of a preexisting membrane framework of endoplasmic reticulum er b membrane components of rer were assembled de novo within the structure during the rer morphogenesis and c rer released membrane vesicles that moved to the GA and contributed to the morphogenesis of the golgi apparatus possible causative mechanisms involved in the proliferation of the secretory system in je virusinfected pc cells are discussed,333,golgi apparatus
1911660,in the present T0 the structural and functional role of smooth endoplasmic reticulum was investigated in bullfrog olfactory axon terminals structural evidence obtained from this T0 indicated that this vesiculotubular organelle becomes a more elaborate network of anastomosing tubules near the nerve terminal located in the olfactory lobe of frog brain further structural evidence suggested that CM of the SER pinch off to give rise to some electronlucent LDV of approximately nm diameter microvesicles ultrastructural cytochemistry was employed in the present study to demonstrate that olfactory axon terminal smooth endoplasmic reticulum actively sequesters ca however a VL amount of electrondense product calcium oxalate was associated with microvesicles located at a distance from the synapse in contrast to those clustered near the synapse which usually did not contain this RP results from camgadenosinetriphosphatase atpase cytochemistry showed a similar pattern of CSD with smooth endoplasmic reticulum being densely labeled with atpase reaction product lead phosphate but aggregated microvesicles in the nerve terminal generally lacking this electrondense product therefore it is concluded that olfactory axonal SER plays a role in the regulation of intraneuronal ca C2 and that the casequestering activity of this membranous organelle is dependent upon enzymatic hydrolysis of atp conversely the microvesicles particularly those accumulated near the synapse lack this capumping capacity thus if some of the microvesicles originate from smooth endoplasmic reticulum CM which are capable of pumping ca but these vesicles themselves lack this capacity one can postulate that the ca pumps are either removed from the newly formed microvesicle CM or are somehow incapacitated in situ in the membrane,59,smooth endoplasmic reticulum

14478977,this T0 examined the link between CR changes due to BL SE and subthreshold bipolarity molecular circadian rhythms PSG and actigraphy data were studied in young healthy male subjects divided into high and low mood disorder questionnaire mdq score groups during the first days of the study the subjects were exposed to dailyliving light lux for hours before HS saliva and buccal cells were collected times a day for consecutive days during the subsequent days the subjects were exposed to bright light lux and saliva and buccal cell samples were collected in the same way molecular circadian rhythms were analyzed using sine regression circadian rhythms of cortisol f p and relative perarntl gene expression f p showed a delayed acrophase in both CG T3 BL SE the high mdq score group showed a significant delay in acrophase compared to the low mdq score group only in salivary cortisol f p the high mdq score group showed hypersensitivity in cortisol rhythm shift after BL exposure suggesting characteristic molecular CR changes in the high mdq score group may be related to biological processes downstream from core circadian clock gene expression,167,circadian rhythm
14512595,we investigate the driven CP translocation through a nanometerscale pore in the presence and absence of hydrodynamics both in good and bad solvent we present our results on tension propagating along the polymer segment on the cis side that is measured for the first time using our method that works also in the presence of hydrodynamics for simulations we use stochastic rotation dynamics also called multiparticle collision dynamics we find that in the good solvent the tension propagates very similarly whether hydrodynamics is included or not only the tensed segment is by a constant factor shorter in the presence of hydrodynamics the shorter tensed segment and the hydrodynamic interactions contribute to a smaller friction for the translocating polymer when hydrodynamics is included which shows as smaller waiting times and a smaller exponent in the scaling of the translocation time with the CP length in the bad solvent hydrodynamics has a minimal effect on CP translocation in contrast to the good solvent where it speeds up translocation we find that under badsolvent conditions tension does not spread appreciably along the polymer consequently translocation time does not scale with the CP length by measuring the effective friction in a setup where a CP in free solvent is pulled by a constant force at the end we find that hydrodynamics does speed up collective CP motion in the bad solvent even more effectively than in the good solvent however hydrodynamics has a negligible effect on the motion of individual monomers within the highly correlated globular conformation on the cis side and hence on the entire driven translocation under badsolvent conditions,188,polymer
3478983,we examined the uptake and intracellular transport of the fluorescent glucosylceramide analogue ndimethyl bodipytmpentanoylglucosyl sphingosine cdmbglccer in human skin fibroblasts and we compared its SMB to that of the corresponding FL analogues of sphingomyelin galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide all four FL analogues were readily transferred from defatted bsa to the plasma membrane during incubation at degrees c when cells treated with cdmbglccer were washed warmed to degrees c and subsequently incubated with defatted bsa to remove FL lipid at the cell surface strong fluorescence was observed at the GA as well as weaker labeling at the NE and other IM similar results were obtained with cdmbgalactosylceramide except that labeling of the GA was weaker than with cdmbglccer internalization of cdmbglccer was not inhibited by various treatments including atp depletion or warming to degrees c and biochemical analysis demonstrated that the lipid was not metabolized during its internalization however accumulation of cdmbglccer at the golgi apparatus was reduced when cells were treated with a nonfluorescent analogue of glucosylceramide suggesting that accumulation of cdmbglccer at the golgi apparatus was a saturable process in contrast cells treated with cdmbanalogues of sphingomyelin or lactosylceramide internalized the fluorescent lipid into a punctate DP of fluorescence during warming at degrees c and this process was temperature and energy dependent these results with cdmbsphingomyelin and cdmblactosylceramide were analogous to those obtained with another fluorescent analogue of sphingomyelin in which labeling of endocytic LDV and BPM lipid recycling were documented koval m and r e pagano j cell biol incubation of perforated cells with cdmbsphingomyelin resulted in prominent labeling of the NE and other intracellular CM similar to the pattern observed with cdmbglccer in intact cells these observations are consistent with the transbilayer movement of FL analogues of glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide at the BPM and early endosomes of human skin fibroblasts and suggest that both endocytic and nonendocytic pathways are used in the internalization of these lipids from the BPM,294,plasma membrane
7805224,we previously isolated a cdna of a urea transporter bufo ut from the kidney of the marine toad bufo marinus and demonstrated that the bufo ut was specifically localized on the epithelial membrane of the early distal tubules in the kidney and urinary bladder in the present T0 the CF of bufo ut was investigated using a xenopus oocytes expression system further we examined the effects of Arg VT avt on urea transport in isolated cells from the toad urinary bladder when expressed in xenopus oocytes bufo ut induced more than a fold increase in curea uptake compared with waterinjected control oocytes phloretin a urea transport inhibitor fully blocked the increase of urea uptake in epithelial cells isolated from the toad UB addition of avt to the medium increased the urea uptake in a concentrationdependent manner m to examine the relationship between the bufo ut protein expression and an increase of urea transportability we analyzed the time course of the bufo ut expression levels and urea uptake in the cells treated with m avt treatment of m avt increased the urea uptake in the cells T3 and h incubation but not after h according to the immunoblot analysis ut protein expression was coincident with the results of urea uptake in the avttreated cells these results suggest that bufo ut isolated from the kidney functions as an avtmediated urea transporter in the UB of the toad,121,urinary bladder

8731553,in this paper we describe the identification of a gene msdwf coding for a putative GA betahydroxylase gaox whose natural mutation is conditioning a dw growth phenotype in medicago sativa the dw phenotype could not be complemented with grafting which indicates that the bioactive gibberellin compound necessary for shoot elongation is immobile on the contrary exogenously added gibberellic acid restored normal growth the genetic position of the msdwf gene was mapped to LG lg and the physical location was delimited by mapbased cloning using medicago truncatula genomic resources based on the similar appearance and behavior of the dw medicago sativa plants to the pea stem length mutant le as well as the synthenic map position of the two genes it was postulated that msdwf and pea le are orthologs the comparison of wild type and mutant allele sequences of msgaox revealed an amino acid change in a conserved position in the mutant allele which most probably impaired the function of the enzyme our results indicate that the dw phenotype was the consequence of this mutation,15,gibberellin

3855228,we studied the effect of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf on wound healing in db/db mice wound closure T3 fullthickness excision of skin was markedly delayed in diabetic mice compared to normoglycemic mice a single application of bfgf caused a marked acceleration of wound healing in a dosedependent manner there were no HCM scars or unlimited GT formation in regenerated tissues treated with any doses of bfgf under histological examination the repeated application of bfgf for d showed a bellshaped DR in the rate of wound closure and the optimal dose was as small as mu g per wound reduced angiogenesis and GT formation were observed in diabetic mice compared to NM and bfgf treatment restored both responses to significant levels the beneficial effect of bfgf on wound healing would be largely explained by enhanced angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation,58,granulation tissue
7479099,this T0 presents an nmrbased metabonomic approach to elucidate the overall endogenous PSA effects of a wholegrain diet two diets with similar levels of dietary fibre and macronutrients but with contrasting C2 of wholegrain ingredients were prepared from wholegrain rye wholegrain diet wgd and nonwholegrain wheat nonwholegrain diet nwd and fed to four pigs in a crossover design plasma samples were collected after d on each diet and h nmr spectra were acquired on these partial least squares regression discriminant analysis plsda on spectra obtained for plasma samples revealed that the spectral e inner SC thus there were steep gradients of turgor of up to megapascal bar over a distance of only micrometer in the more basal and rather mature region gradients were less pronounced because cell turgor approximately pii and psi approximately across the SC there were also no gradients of psi across the tissue gradients of cell turgor and pii increased when the endosperm was removed from the cotyledons allowing for a better water supply they were reduced by increasing the OP of the root medium or by cutting off the cotyledons or the entire hook if the root was excised to interrupt the main source for water effects became more pronounced gradients CR disappeared and turgor fell to megapascal in all layers within hours when excised hypocotyls were infiltrated with millimolar cacl solution under pressure via the cut surface gradients in turgor could be restored or even increased when turgor was measured in individual cortical cells while pressurizing the xylem rapid responses were recorded and changes of turgor exceeded that of applied pressure gradients could also be reestablished in excised hypocotyls by abrading the cuticle allowing for a water supply from the wet environment the steep gradients of turgor and osmotic pressure suggest a considerable supply of osmotic solutes from the phloem to the growing tissue on the basis of a new theoretical RPA the data are discussed in terms of a coupling between water and solute flows and of a compartmentation of water and solutes both of which affect water status and extension growth,173,osmotic pressure
10723268,this T0 was conducted to determine the prevalence of subclinical entheseal involvement at the greater trochanter level by ultrasound in patients with spondyloarthritis fortysix patients with SpA and healthy age and sexmatched controls were studied all patients with no clinical evidence of enthesopathy at the greater trochanter underwent an ultrasound examination the following three entheses were scanned bilaterally anterior IS of gluteus minimus anterior insertion of gluteus medius and posterior insertion of gluteus medius ultrasound findings of enthesopathy were thickening calcifications bone erosions enthesophytes bursitis and PD signal a toes it destroy only receptors or are there other targets we previously demonstrated that hpiv and hns bind to OS containing the motif neuacÃŽÂ±galÃŽÂ²glcnac m amonsen d f smith r d cummings and g m air j virol in the present study we tested the IB specificity of hpiv on the consortium for PET glycomics glycan array and found that hpiv binds to OS containing the same motif we determined the specificities of n on red blood cells soluble smallmolecule and glycoprotein substrates and the glycan array and compared them to the specificities of h hpiv and but not hpiv cleaved their ligands on red blood cells hpiv and cleaved their neuacÃŽÂ± ligands on the glycan array hpiv and also cleaved neuacÃŽÂ± ligands bound by influenza a virus while all three hns exhibited similar affinities for all cleavable soluble substrates their MICs were to fold higher on small molecules than on glycoproteins in addition some soluble glycoproteins were not cleaved despite containing oligosaccharides that were cleaved on the glycan array we conclude that the susceptibility of an oligosaccharide ATP to n increases when the substrate is fixed to a surface these findings suggest that hn may undergo a conformational change that activates n upon receptor binding at a cell surface,267,substrate

3077280,previous studies indicated that in pancreatic islets the amount of glucosederived pyruvate that enters mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation is approximately equal to that entering via decarboxylation and that both carboxylation and decarboxylation are correlated with capacitation of glucose metabolism and insulin PR the relatively high rate of carboxylation is consistent with the current studys finding that pyruvate carboxylase is as abundant in pancreatic islets as it is in liver and kidney since islets do not contain phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and therefore cannot carry out glyconeogenesis from pyruvate the carboxylase might be present in the islet to participate in novel anaplerotic reactions this idea was first explored by incubating mitochondria from various tissues with pyruvate mitochondria from tissues such as pancreatic islets CL and kidney in which pyruvate carboxylase is abundant exported a large amount of malate and little or no citrate isocitrate and AST to the medium the amount of malate within the mitochondria was that in the medium when pancreatic islet mitochondria were incubated with cpyruvate radioactive carbon appeared in the medium primarily in malate very little radioactivity appeared in amino acids and little or no radioactivity appeared in citrate and isocitrate carbon of pyruvate can be incorporated into malate and other CAC intermediates only via carboxylation as this carbon would be lost via decarboxylation when pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle as acetylcoa via the Pyr dehydrogenase reaction the amount of malate formed equaled the co formed and the radioactivity from c of pyruvate recovered in malate slightly exceeded the formation of co in agreement with our previous studies that reported a high rate of carboxylation of Pyr in intact islets when intact pancreatic islets were incubated with methyl ucsuccinate as a mitochondrial source of fourcarbon dicarboxylic acids radioactivity appeared in pyruvate and lactate taken together with previous studies the current results suggest that during glucoseinduced insulin secretion there is a shuttle operating across the mitochondrial membrane in which glucosederived Pyr is taken up by mitochondria and carboxylated to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase the oxaloacetate is converted to malate which exits the mitochondrion where in the cytosol it is decarboxylated to pyruvate in the reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme this Pyr reenters mitochondrial pools such a cycle produces nadph in the cytosol since it is a cycle this shuttle can produce far more nadph than the PPP which is known to be a very minor route of glucose metabolism in the isletabstract truncated at words,202,citric acid cycle

1977255,in an effort to understand the cellular basis of entrainment of circadian oscillators we have studied the role of membrane potential changes in the neurons which comprise the ocular circadian pacemaker of bulla gouldiana in mediating phase shifts of the ocular CR we report that intracellular recording was used to measure directly the effects of the phase shifting agents light serotonin and bromocamp on the membrane potential of the basal retinal SN we found that light pulses evoke a transient depolarization followed by a smaller sustained depolarization application of serotonin produced a biphasic response a transient depolarization followed by a sustained hyperpolarization application of a membrane permeable analog of the intracellular second messenger camp bromocamp elicited sustained hyperpolarization and occasionally a weak phasic depolarization changing the membrane potential of the basal retinal neurons directly and selectively with intracellularly injected current phase shifts the ocular circadian rhythm both ON and hyperpolarizing current can shift the phase of the circadian FEO depolarizing current mimics the phase shifting action of light while hyperpolarizing current produces phase shifts which are transposed approximately degrees in circadian time to depolarization altering brn membrane potential with ionic treatments depolarizing with elevated k seawater or hyperpolarizing with lowered na seawater produces phase shifts similar to current i.t. the lightinduced depolarization of the basal retinal SN is necessary for phase shifts by CS suppressing the lightinduced depolarization with injected current inhibits lightinduced phase shifts the ability of membrane potential changes to shift oscillator phase is dependent on extracellular calcium reducing extracellular free ca from mm to x m inhibits lightinduced phase shifts without blocking the photic response of the brns the results indicate that changes in the membrane potential of the pacemaker SN play a critical role in phase shifting the CR and imply that a voltagedependent and calciumdependent process possibly ca influx shifts oscillator phase in response to light,41,circadian rhythm

9711743,previous studies have shown that the overexpression of tropomyosins leads to isoformspecific alterations in the morphology of subcellular compartments in neuronal cells here we have examined the role of the most abundant set of isoforms from the gammatm gene by knocking out the alternatively spliced cterminal exon d despite the widespread location of exon dcontaining isoforms mice were healthy and viable compensation by products containing the cterminal exon c was seen in the AD brain while SN from these mice show a mild phenotype at one day in culture neurons revealed a significant morphological alteration with an increase in the branching of dendrites and axons after four DIC our data suggest that this effect is mediated via altered stability of AFs in the growth cones we conclude that exon dcontaining isoforms are not essential for survival of neuronal cells and that isoform choice from the gammatm gene is flexible in the BB although PET redundancy does not exist between tropomyosin genes these results suggest that significant redundancy exists between products from the same gene,151,brain

14879216,we present a simple analytical theory of a flexible polymer chain dissolved in a good solvent carrying permanent freely oriented dipoles on the monomers we take into account the dipole correlations within the RPA rpa as well as a dielectric heterogeneity in the internal polymer volume relative to the bulk solution we demonstrate that the dipole correlations of monomers can be taken into account as pairwise ones only when the polymer chain is in a coil conformation in this case the dipole correlations manifest themselves through the keesom interactions of the permanent dipoles on the other hand the dielectric heterogeneity effect dielectric mismatch effect leads to the effective interaction between the monomers of the polymeric coil both of these effects can be taken into account by renormalizing the second virial coefficient of the monomermonomer volume interactions we establish that in the case when the solvent dielectric permittivity exceeds the dielectric permittivity of the polymeric material the dielectric mismatch effect competes with the dipole attractive interactions leading to CP coil expansion in the opposite case both the dielectric mismatch effect and the dipole attractive interaction lead to the CP coil collapse we analyse the coilglobule transition caused by the dipole correlations of monomers within the manybody theory we demonstrate that accounting for the dipole correlations higher than the pairwise ones smooths this pure electrostatics driven coilglobule transition of the polymer chain,187,polymer
231761,a method for determining initial rates of unidirectional radiofe uptake from a ferric chelate of nitrilotriacetic acid by human DU biopsy specimens in vitro has been devised cocyanocobalamin was used as an extracellular fluid marker and was shown to give results in close PA with other markers uptake was linear for up to min and exhibited saturation kinetics over the concentration range mumole in the presence of dinitrophenol and fluoride uptake was reduced by approxi indicating dependence on metabolic SE uptake of fe was markedly diminished at reduced incubation temperatures demonstrating a high activation SE for the uptake process many of the criteria for the demonstration that the initial uptake of fe depends on an active transport mechanism have been fulfilled the apparent distribution volume of clabelled NTA chelate did not exceed the ECF space suggesting that fe is transferred to TPS receptors on the enterocyte the findings are discussed in relation to the possibility that uptake may be a ratecontrolling step for the regulation of net intestinal absorption of fe in man,133,extracellular fluid

4546663,this T0 was undertaken to investigate the enzymatic regulation of the biosynthesis of vasoconstrictor prostanoids by resting and interleukin ilbetastimulated HUVE cells huvecs biosynthesis of eicosanoids in response to ilbeta exogenous labeled AA aa or histamine as well as their spontaneous release was evaluated by means of hplc and ria huvecs exposed to ilbeta produced prostaglandin pg i for no longer than seconds T3 the substrate was added irrespective of the cyclooxygenase cox activity whereas the time course of pge and pgd formation was parallel to the cox activity the ratio of pge to pgd produced by huvecs was similar to that obtained by purified cox and cox production of pgfalpha from exogenous aa was limited and similar in both resting and ilbetatreated cells pgfalpha was the main prostanoid released into the medium during exposure to ilbeta whereas when huvecs treated with ilbeta were stimulated with histamine or exogenous aa pge was released in a higher quantity than pgfalpha pgfalpha released into the medium during treatment with ilbeta and the biosynthesis of pge and pgd in response to exogenous aa or histamine increased with cox expression whereas this did not occur in the case of pgi we observed that pgi synthase pgis mrna C2 were not modified by the SE to ilbeta but the enzyme was partially inactivated when sncl was added to the incubation medium the transformation of exogenous aaderived pgh into pge and pgd was totally diverted toward pgfalpha overall these results support the conclusions that pge and pgd and also probably pgfalpha were nonenzymatically derived from pgh in huvecs the concept that a high ratio of pgh was released by the ilbetatreated huvecs and isomerized outside the cell into pge and pgd was supported by the biosynthesis of thromboxane b by coxinactivated platelets indicating the uptake by platelets of huvecderived pgh the ilbetainduced increase in the release of pgh by huvecs was suppressed by the coxselective inhibitor sc and correlated with both cox expression and pgis inactivation an RPA to the mechanism of inactivation of pgis by the exposure to ilbeta was performed by using labeled endoperoxides as ATP the involvement of ho in the pgis inactivation was supported by the fact that deferoxamine PDTC dmso mannitol and captopril antagonized the effect of ilbeta on pgis to different degrees the no synthase inhibitor ngmonomethyllarginine also antagonized the pgis GABA effect of ilbeta indicating that no was also involved no reacts with o to form peroxynitrite which has been reported to inactivate pgis homolytic fission of the oo bond of peroxynitrite yields no and ho the fact that carboxyphenyltetramethylimidazolineoxyloxide carboxyptio which reacts with no to form no dramatically potentiated the ilbeta effect suggests that no could be a species implicated in the inactivation of pgis cooperation of ho was supported by the fact that dmso partially antagonized the effect of carboxyptio although our results on the exact mechanism of the inactivation of pgis caused by ilbeta were not conclusive they strongly suggest that both no and ho were involved,351,substrate

3852398,we investigated floral initiation in the longday monocot lolium temulentum CS ceres by culturing apices explanted from photoperiodically induced plants at various times after one inductive long day onto medium with and without gibberellin apices cultured on the D1 after the inductive long day usually required gibberellin in the medium to initiate floral morphogenesis while apices explanted on the second day T3 induction did not require GA apices explanted on the first day after induction onto medium without gibberellin grew vegetatively for many days but a severalday exposure to SC medium with GA at any time caused most apices to initiate floral morphogenesis the GA synthesis inhibitor ancymidol when applied to plants before apex excision and when present in the culture medium reduced floral initiation by more than in the absence of added GA in the medium but it was ineffective in the presence of GA these results indicated that floral initiation in photoperiodically induced plants resulted from two signals acting at the apex the first signal induced the apex into a florally determined state and then the second signal GA elicited expression of the florally determined state leaf removal and SC of apices from plants previously treated with gibberellin provided evidence that the leafapplied GA did not itself act on the apex to cause floral determination or initiation rather the exogenous GA appeared to stimulate the production of a signal in the leaves that then led to floral initiation,205,gibberellin

4133379,the ability of melatonin to stimulate luteal steroidogenesis directly in the ewe was investigated by using a perfusion cannula system in vivo and luteinised granulosa cells in vitro exposure to human chorionic gonodotrophin hcg or ovine luteinising hormone olh as positive controls significantly stimulated progesterone secretion by the perfused CL within minutes and by granulosa cells T3 two days of SC melatonin perfused through the CL at a physiological concentration significantly stimulated progesterone secretion but the response was not as rapid as that to hcg the significant stimulation of progesterone by melatonin in the perfusion system was maintained for between and T2 melatonin significantly stimulated progesterone production by GCs in vitro after two days of SC but the degree of response depended on the size of the follicles from which the cells were obtained these results demonstrate that melatonin can act directly on the corpus luteum to increase progesterone production and that its mechanism of action appears to be different from that of hcg or olh in the ewe this action of melatonin may be related to the reported improved luteal CF late in the breeding season after the prolonged exposure of ewes to melatonin,65,corpus luteum

2032726,previous studies suggest that the sympathetic innervation of the sweat PG in the rat is initially noradrenergic and during development undergoes a transition in neurotransmitter phenotype to become cholinergic to characterize this system and its OD further we have examined the adrenergic and ACh components of the sec response in adult and immature rats and have studied the onset of sweating in the plantar SGs of developing rats stimulation of the sciatic nerve in adult rats elicited a sec response which was completely blocked by the ACh antagonist atropine and was unaffected by adrenergic antagonists indicating that nerveevoked secretion was ACh in AD rats the SGs were quite CS to cholinergic agonists in addition to acetylcholine the mature sweat gland innervation contains vasoactive intestinal peptide vip in some rats the i.t. of vip alone elicited a sec response which was blocked by atropine suggesting that the response to vip was mediated cholinergically in contrast to cholinergic agonists the glands responded relatively infrequently and with reduced volumes of sweat to the alpha and betaadrenergic agonists fluoronorepinephrine and isoproterenol however when vip which is a potent vasodilator was simultaneously injected with adrenergic agonists glands in many of the injected footpads exhibited a secretory response the response to adrenergic agonists in combination with vip was reduced by atropine and by phentolamine plus propranolol but was blocked CR only by a combination of the three antagonists indicating that both adrenergic and ACh mechanisms were involved in immature rats sweating evoked by nerve stimulation first appeared at days of age in of the rats tested both the percentage of rats sweating and the number of active PG increased rapidly at days of the rats tested exhibited some active glands and by days all rats tested exhibited a secretory response in dayold rats nerveevoked sweating was almost completely inhibited by local injection of microm atropine but was unaffected by phentolamine and propranolol in concentrations up to microm similarly the glands were sensitive to microm muscarine but they exhibited no secretory response to the alphaadrenergic agonists clonidine and fluoronorepinephrine nor to the betaadrenergic agonist isoproterenol at concentrations up to microm the simultaneous injection of vip with adrenergic agonists did not reveal an adrenergically mediated secretory response in dayold animalsabstract truncated at words,100,cholinergic

3889819,it has been shown that changes to the frequency of sucking by the pouch young do not affect the time of reactivation of the quiescent corpus luteum and diapause embryo in bettongia penicillata these observations led to the suggestion that the CL may have an inherent maximum duration of quiescence the aim of the present T0 was to investigate the effect of the age of the CL on the timing of its reactivation ovulation fails to occur post partum in female b penicillata isolated from males and the introduction of a male b penicillata induces oestrus in females suckling a young in the pouch oestrus was induced from day of lactation to day in different females and the corpus luteum became quiescent all parturitions occurred between day and day of lactation average day at the time expected if the CL had been formed post partum duration of quiescence of the corpus luteum ranged from days to days compared with days in females that mated post partum the results show that the age of the CL does not affect the timing of its redevelopment and release of the embryo from diapause near the end of the period of the young being suckled within the pouch,139,corpus luteum
5591393,this study characterizes the expression of mo chemoattractant protein mcp and the relative distribution of immune cell populations in the bovine CL throughout the estrous cycle immunodetectable mcp was evident in corpora lutea of cows at days and postovulation day ovulation n cowsstage day corpora lutea contained minimal mcp that was confined primarily to blood vessels in contrast relatively intense staining for mcp was observed in corpora lutea from days and postovulation mcp was again most evident in the cells of the vasculature but it was also observed surrounding individual luteal cells particularly by day an increase in immunohistochemical expression of mcp on days and postovulation corresponded with increases in mcp mrna and protein in corpora lutea as determined by northern blot analysis and elisa monocytes and macrophages were the most abundant immune cells detected in the bovine corpus luteum followed by cd and cd t lymphocytes in all instances day corpora lutea contained fewer immune cells than corpora lutea from days and in conclusion increased expression of mcp was accompanied by the accumulation of immune cells in the corpora lutea of cows during the latter half of the estrous cycle days postovulation these results support the hypothesis that mcp promotes immune cell recruitment into the CL to facilitate luteal regression these results also raise a provocative issue however concerning the recruitment of immune cells several days in advance of the ON of luteal regression,21,corpus luteum
1429264,we studied the vertical gradient in lung expansion in rabbits in the prone and supine body positions postmortem we used videomicroscopy to measure the size of surface alveoli through transparent parietal pleural windows at dependent and nondependent CS separated in height by cm at FRC frc we compared the AM size measured in situ with that measured in the isolated lungs at different deflationary transpulmonary pressures to obtain TPP pleural surface pressure in situ the vertical gradient in transpulmonary pressure averaged sd cmhocm height n in the supine position and sd cmhocm n in the PP in MV rabbits we used the rib capsule technique to measure pleural liquid pressure at different heights of the chest in prone and supine positions at frc the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure averaged cmhocm in the SP and cmhocm in the PP the vertical gradients in pleural liquid pressure were all less than the hydrostatic value cmhocm which indicates that pleural liquid is not generally in hydrostatic equilibrium both pleural surface pressure and pleural liquid pressure measurements show a greater vertical gradient in the supine than in the PP this suggests a close relationship between pleural surface pressure and pleural liquid pressure previous results in the dog and pony showed relatively high vertical gradients in the supine position and relatively small gradients in the prone position this SMB is similar to the present results in rabbits thus the vertical gradient is independent of animal size and might be related to chest shape and weight of HR and ABD contents,186,prone position

4070448,we report the total lipid composition and phospholipid asymmetry of a BPM preparation isolated from a schwann cell line nft derived from a human neurofibroma the specific activities of three plasma membrane markers nucleotidase nakatpase and cnpase were fold fold and fold higher respectively in the BPM fraction compared to the specific MICs found in the total homogenate the TPS activities of the marker enzymes of intracellular membranes in the isolated BPM fraction indicated little contamination with intracellular organelles the enrichment of cholesterol fold sphingomyelin fold and glycolipids cerebrosides fold sulfatides fold also indicated a high degree of purity of the plasma membrane fraction the high content of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine and of total phospholipid and the low phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine content and of the total phospholipid were also characteristic of the plasma membrane fraction derived from this cell line the transbilayer phospholipid CSD of the plasma membrane in IN cells and in the isolated BPM fraction was investigated by using phospholipase a bee venom and sphingomyelinase s aureus the phospholipid asymmetry of nft BPM followed the general features of phospholipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cells sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were preferentially located in the outer leaflet and respectively while the aminophospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were in the inner half of the membrane and respectively a high percentage of the total BPM phosphatidylinositol was found in the outer side of the membrane indicating a decreased asymmetric CSD for this negatively charged phospholipid the phospholipid asymmetry found in the plasma membrane vesicle fraction corroborated the phospholipid asymmetry of the IN cells thus confirming that the BPM vesicles maintained the original orientation and lipid asymmetry after homogenization andor sonication,155,plasma membrane
3852398,we investigated floral initiation in the longday monocot lolium temulentum CS ceres by culturing apices explanted from photoperiodically induced plants at various times after one inductive long day onto medium with and without gibberellin apices cultured on the D1 after the inductive long day usually required gibberellin in the medium to initiate floral morphogenesis while apices explanted on the second day T3 induction did not require GA apices explanted on the first day after induction onto medium without gibberellin grew vegetatively for many days but a severalday exposure to SC medium with GA at any time caused most apices to initiate floral morphogenesis the GA synthesis inhibitor ancymidol when applied to plants before apex excision and when present in the culture medium reduced floral initiation by more than in the absence of added GA in the medium but it was ineffective in the presence of GA these results indicated that floral initiation in photoperiodically induced plants resulted from two signals acting at the apex the first signal induced the apex into a florally determined state and then the second signal GA elicited expression of the florally determined state leaf removal and SC of apices from plants previously treated with gibberellin provided evidence that the leafapplied GA did not itself act on the apex to cause floral determination or initiation rather the exogenous GA appeared to stimulate the production of a signal in the leaves that then led to floral initiation,180,gibberellin
3583901,we reported previously that a reorganization of microfilaments can be observed when macrophages are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide lps this reorganization is not detected with current methods in macrophages of an lpsnonresponsive C3 mouse these results suggest that the observed MF response might be involved in a macrophageactivating process induced by lps to investigate this we studied the effect of cytochalasin d cd which inhibits reorganization of microfilaments on lpsinduced TN factor tnf production a concentration of cd incapable of affecting filamentous actin by itself was used in these experiments when this concentration of cd was added T3 lps stimulation MF reorganization and tnf production were inhibited the suppressive effect of cd on tnf production was confirmed by the observation that tnfalpha mrna expression was also inhibited by cd this GABA effect of cd was not specific to tnf because the production of interleukin and prostaglandin e were also inhibited these effects of cd were observed only when cd was added within the first min T3 lps stimulation these results suggest that the cdsensitive MF response is essential in the signaling pathway for the production of certain monokines in lpsstimulated macrophages,99,microfilament
